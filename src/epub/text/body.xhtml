<h2>LOST FACE</h2>
<p>It was the end.&nbsp; Subienkow had travelled a long trail of
bitterness and horror, homing like a dove for the capitals of
Europe, and here, farther away than ever, in Russian America, the
trail ceased.&nbsp; He sat in the snow, arms tied behind him,
waiting the torture.&nbsp; He stared curiously before him at a
huge Cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain.&nbsp; The
men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the
women.&nbsp; That they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the
man&rsquo;s cries attested.</p>
<p>Subienkow looked on, and shuddered.&nbsp; He was not afraid to
die.&nbsp; He had carried his life too long in his hands, on that
weary trail from Warsaw to Nulato, to shudder at mere
dying.&nbsp; But he objected to the torture.&nbsp; It offended
his soul.&nbsp; And this offence, in turn, was not due to the
mere pain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain
would make of him.&nbsp; He knew that he would pray, and beg, and
entreat, even as Big Ivan and the others that had gone
before.&nbsp; This would not be nice.&nbsp; To pass out bravely
and cleanly, with a smile and a jest&mdash;ah! that would have
been the way.&nbsp; But to lose control, to have his soul upset
by the pangs of the flesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to
become the veriest beast&mdash;ah, that was what was so
terrible.</p>
<p>There had been no chance to escape.&nbsp; From the beginning,
when he dreamed the fiery dream of Poland&rsquo;s independence,
he had become a puppet in the hands of Fate.&nbsp; From the
beginning, at Warsaw, at St. Petersburg, in the Siberian mines,
in Kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves, Fate had
been driving him to this end.&nbsp; Without doubt, in the
foundations of the world was graved this end for him&mdash;for
him, who was so fine and sensitive, whose nerves scarcely
sheltered under his skin, who was a dreamer, and a poet, and an
artist.&nbsp; Before he was dreamed of, it had been determined
that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that constituted him
should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and to die
in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last
boundaries of the world.</p>
<p>He sighed.&nbsp; So that thing before him was Big
Ivan&mdash;Big Ivan the giant, the man without nerves, the man of
iron, the Cossack turned freebooter of the seas, who was as
phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that what was
pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him.&nbsp; Well,
well, trust these Nulato Indians to find Big Ivan&rsquo;s nerves
and trace them to the roots of his quivering soul.&nbsp; They
were certainly doing it.&nbsp; It was inconceivable that a man
could suffer so much and yet live.&nbsp; Big Ivan was paying for
his low order of nerves.&nbsp; Already he had lasted twice as
long as any of the others.</p>
<p>Subienkow felt that he could not stand the Cossack&rsquo;s
sufferings much longer.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t Ivan die?&nbsp; He
would go mad if that screaming did not cease.&nbsp; But when it
did cease, his turn would come.&nbsp; And there was Yakaga
awaiting him, too, grinning at him even now in
anticipation&mdash;Yakaga, whom only last week he had kicked out
of the fort, and upon whose face he had laid the lash of his
dog-whip.&nbsp; Yakaga would attend to him.&nbsp; Doubtlessly
Yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures, more exquisite
nerve-racking.&nbsp; Ah! that must have been a good one, from the
way Ivan screamed.&nbsp; The squaws bending over him stepped back
with laughter and clapping of hands.&nbsp; Subienkow saw the
monstrous thing that had been perpetrated, and began to laugh
hysterically.&nbsp; The Indians looked at him in wonderment that
he should laugh.&nbsp; But Subienkow could not stop.</p>
<p>This would never do.&nbsp; He controlled himself, the
spasmodic twitchings slowly dying away.&nbsp; He strove to think
of other things, and began reading back in his own life.&nbsp; He
remembered his mother and his father, and the little spotted
pony, and the French tutor who had taught him dancing and sneaked
him an old worn copy of Voltaire.&nbsp; Once more he saw Paris,
and dreary London, and gay Vienna, and Rome.&nbsp; And once more
he saw that wild group of youths who had dreamed, even as he, the
dream of an independent Poland with a king of Poland on the
throne at Warsaw.&nbsp; Ah, there it was that the long trail
began.&nbsp; Well, he had lasted longest.&nbsp; One by one,
beginning with the two executed at St. Petersburg, he took up the
count of the passing of those brave spirits.&nbsp; Here one had
been beaten to death by a jailer, and there, on that bloodstained
highway of the exiles, where they had marched for endless months,
beaten and maltreated by their Cossack guards, another had
dropped by the way.&nbsp; Always it had been
savagery&mdash;brutal, bestial savagery.&nbsp; They had
died&mdash;of fever, in the mines, under the knout.&nbsp; The
last two had died after the escape, in the battle with the
Cossacks, and he alone had won to Kamtchatka with the stolen
papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the
snow.</p>
<p>It had been nothing but savagery.&nbsp; All the years, with
his heart in studios, and theatres, and courts, he had been
hemmed in by savagery.&nbsp; He had purchased his life with
blood.&nbsp; Everybody had killed.&nbsp; He had killed that
traveller for his passports.&nbsp; He had proved that he was a
man of parts by duelling with two Russian officers on a single
day.&nbsp; He had had to prove himself in order to win to a place
among the fur-thieves.&nbsp; He had had to win to that
place.&nbsp; Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across
all Siberia and Russia.&nbsp; He could not escape that way.&nbsp;
The only way was ahead, across the dark and icy sea of Bering to
Alaska.&nbsp; The way had led from savagery to deeper
savagery.&nbsp; On the scurvy-rotten ships of the fur-thieves,
out of food and out of water, buffeted by the interminable storms
of that stormy sea, men had become animals.&nbsp; Thrice he had
sailed east from Kamtchatka.&nbsp; And thrice, after all manner
of hardship and suffering, the survivors had come back to
Kamtchatka.&nbsp; There had been no outlet for escape, and he
could not go back the way he had come, for the mines and the
knout awaited him.</p>
<p>Again, the fourth and last time, he had sailed east.&nbsp; He
had been with those who first found the fabled Seal Islands; but
he had not returned with them to share the wealth of furs in the
mad orgies of Kamtchatka.&nbsp; He had sworn never to go
back.&nbsp; He knew that to win to those dear capitals of Europe
he must go on.&nbsp; So he had changed ships and remained in the
dark new land.&nbsp; His comrades were Slavonian hunters and
Russian adventurers, Mongols and Tartars and Siberian aborigines;
and through the savages of the new world they had cut a path of
blood.&nbsp; They had massacred whole villages that refused to
furnish the fur-tribute; and they, in turn, had been massacred by
ships&rsquo; companies.&nbsp; He, with one Finn, had been the
sole survivor of such a company.&nbsp; They had spent a winter of
solitude and starvation on a lonely Aleutian isle, and their
rescue in the spring by another fur-ship had been one chance in a
thousand.</p>
<p>But always the terrible savagery had hemmed him in.&nbsp;
Passing from ship to ship, and ever refusing to return, he had
come to the ship that explored south.&nbsp; All down the Alaska
coast they had encountered nothing but hosts of savages.&nbsp;
Every anchorage among the beetling islands or under the frowning
cliffs of the mainland had meant a battle or a storm.&nbsp;
Either the gales blew, threatening destruction, or the war canoes
came off, manned by howling natives with the war-paint on their
faces, who came to learn the bloody virtues of the
sea-rovers&rsquo; gunpowder.&nbsp; South, south they had coasted,
clear to the myth-land of California.&nbsp; Here, it was said,
were Spanish adventurers who had fought their way up from
Mexico.&nbsp; He had had hopes of those Spanish
adventurers.&nbsp; Escaping to them, the rest would have been
easy&mdash;a year or two, what did it matter more or
less&mdash;and he would win to Mexico, then a ship, and Europe
would be his.&nbsp; But they had met no Spaniards.&nbsp; Only had
they encountered the same impregnable wall of savagery.&nbsp; The
denizens of the confines of the world, painted for war, had
driven them back from the shores.&nbsp; At last, when one boat
was cut off and every man killed, the commander had abandoned the
quest and sailed back to the north.</p>
<p>The years had passed.&nbsp; He had served under Tebenkoff when
Michaelovski Redoubt was built.&nbsp; He had spent two years in
the Kuskokwim country.&nbsp; Two summers, in the month of June,
he had managed to be at the head of Kotzebue Sound.&nbsp; Here,
at this time, the tribes assembled for barter; here were to be
found spotted deerskins from Siberia, ivory from the Diomedes,
walrus skins from the shores of the Arctic, strange stone lamps,
passing in trade from tribe to tribe, no one knew whence, and,
once, a hunting-knife of English make; and here, Subienkow knew,
was the school in which to learn geography.&nbsp; For he met
Eskimos from Norton Sound, from King Island and St. Lawrence
Island, from Cape Prince of Wales, and Point Barrow.&nbsp; Such
places had other names, and their distances were measured in
days.</p>
<p>It was a vast region these trading savages came from, and a
vaster region from which, by repeated trade, their stone lamps
and that steel knife had come.&nbsp; Subienkow bullied, and
cajoled, and bribed.&nbsp; Every far-journeyer or strange
tribesman was brought before him.&nbsp; Perils unaccountable and
unthinkable were mentioned, as well as wild beasts, hostile
tribes, impenetrable forests, and mighty mountain ranges; but
always from beyond came the rumour and the tale of white-skinned
men, blue of eye and fair of hair, who fought like devils and who
sought always for furs.&nbsp; They were to the east&mdash;far,
far to the east.&nbsp; No one had seen them.&nbsp; It was the
word that had been passed along.</p>
<p>It was a hard school.&nbsp; One could not learn geography very
well through the medium of strange dialects, from dark minds that
mingled fact and fable and that measured distances by
&ldquo;sleeps&rdquo; that varied according to the difficulty of
the going.&nbsp; But at last came the whisper that gave Subienkow
courage.&nbsp; In the east lay a great river where were these
blue-eyed men.&nbsp; The river was called the Yukon.&nbsp; South
of Michaelovski Redoubt emptied another great river which the
Russians knew as the Kwikpak.&nbsp; These two rivers were one,
ran the whisper.</p>
<p>Subienkow returned to Michaelovski.&nbsp; For a year he urged
an expedition up the Kwikpak.&nbsp; Then arose Malakoff, the
Russian half-breed, to lead the wildest and most ferocious of the
hell&rsquo;s broth of mongrel adventurers who had crossed from
Kamtchatka.&nbsp; Subienkow was his lieutenant.&nbsp; They
threaded the mazes of the great delta of the Kwikpak, picked up
the first low hills on the northern bank, and for half a thousand
miles, in skin canoes loaded to the gunwales with trade-goods and
ammunition, fought their way against the five-knot current of a
river that ran from two to ten miles wide in a channel many
fathoms deep.&nbsp; Malakoff decided to build the fort at
Nulato.&nbsp; Subienkow urged to go farther.&nbsp; But he quickly
reconciled himself to Nulato.&nbsp; The long winter was coming
on.&nbsp; It would be better to wait.&nbsp; Early the following
summer, when the ice was gone, he would disappear up the Kwikpak
and work his way to the Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s posts.&nbsp;
Malakoff had never heard the whisper that the Kwikpak was the
Yukon, and Subienkow did not tell him.</p>
<p>Came the building of the fort.&nbsp; It was enforced
labour.&nbsp; The tiered walls of logs arose to the sighs and
groans of the Nulato Indians.&nbsp; The lash was laid upon their
backs, and it was the iron hand of the freebooters of the sea
that laid on the lash.&nbsp; There were Indians that ran away,
and when they were caught they were brought back and
spread-eagled before the fort, where they and their tribe learned
the efficacy of the knout.&nbsp; Two died under it; others were
injured for life; and the rest took the lesson to heart and ran
away no more.&nbsp; The snow was flying ere the fort was
finished, and then it was the time for furs.&nbsp; A heavy
tribute was laid upon the tribe.&nbsp; Blows and lashings
continued, and that the tribute should be paid, the women and
children were held as hostages and treated with the barbarity
that only the fur-thieves knew.</p>
<p>Well, it had been a sowing of blood, and now was come the
harvest.&nbsp; The fort was gone.&nbsp; In the light of its
burning, half the fur-thieves had been cut down.&nbsp; The other
half had passed under the torture.&nbsp; Only Subienkow remained,
or Subienkow and Big Ivan, if that whimpering, moaning thing in
the snow could be called Big Ivan.&nbsp; Subienkow caught Yakaga
grinning at him.&nbsp; There was no gainsaying Yakaga.&nbsp; The
mark of the lash was still on his face.&nbsp; After all,
Subienkow could not blame him, but he disliked the thought of
what Yakaga would do to him.&nbsp; He thought of appealing to
Makamuk, the head-chief; but his judgment told him that such
appeal was useless.&nbsp; Then, too, he thought of bursting his
bonds and dying fighting.&nbsp; Such an end would be quick.&nbsp;
But he could not break his bonds.&nbsp; Caribou thongs were
stronger than he.&nbsp; Still devising, another thought came to
him.&nbsp; He signed for Makamuk, and that an interpreter who
knew the coast dialect should be brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Makamuk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not minded to
die.&nbsp; I am a great man, and it were foolishness for me to
die.&nbsp; In truth, I shall not die.&nbsp; I am not like these
other carrion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the moaning thing that had once been Big Ivan,
and stirred it contemptuously with his toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too wise to die.&nbsp; Behold, I have a great
medicine.&nbsp; I alone know this medicine.&nbsp; Since I am not
going to die, I shall exchange this medicine with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this medicine?&rdquo; Makamuk demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subienkow debated with himself for a moment, as if loth to
part with the secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you.&nbsp; A little bit of this medicine
rubbed on the skin makes the skin hard like a rock, hard like
iron, so that no cutting weapon can cut it.&nbsp; The strongest
blow of a cutting weapon is a vain thing against it.&nbsp; A bone
knife becomes like a piece of mud; and it will turn the edge of
the iron knives we have brought among you.&nbsp; What will you
give me for the secret of the medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you your life,&rdquo; Makamuk made answer
through the interpreter.</p>
<p>Subienkow laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall be a slave in my house until you
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pole laughed more scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Untie my hands and feet and let us talk,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The chief made the sign; and when he was loosed Subienkow
rolled a cigarette and lighted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is foolish talk,&rdquo; said Makamuk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no such medicine.&nbsp; It cannot be.&nbsp; A
cutting edge is stronger than any medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief was incredulous, and yet he wavered.&nbsp; He had
seen too many deviltries of fur-thieves that worked.&nbsp; He
could not wholly doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you your life; but you shall not be a
slave,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subienkow played his game as coolly as if he were bartering
for a foxskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very great medicine.&nbsp; It has saved my life
many times.&nbsp; I want a sled and dogs, and six of your hunters
to travel with me down the river and give me safety to one
day&rsquo;s sleep from Michaelovski Redoubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must live here, and teach us all of your
deviltries,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Subienkow shrugged his shoulders and remained silent.&nbsp; He
blew cigarette smoke out on the icy air, and curiously regarded
what remained of the big Cossack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scar!&rdquo; Makamuk said suddenly, pointing to
the Pole&rsquo;s neck, where a livid mark advertised the slash of
a knife in a Kamtchatkan brawl.&nbsp; &ldquo;The medicine is not
good.&nbsp; The cutting edge was stronger than the
medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strong man that drove the stroke.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Subienkow considered.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Stronger than you, stronger
than your strongest hunter, stronger than he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, with the toe of his moccasin, he touched the
Cossack&mdash;a grisly spectacle, no longer conscious&mdash;yet
in whose dismembered body the pain-racked life clung and was loth
to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, the medicine was weak.&nbsp; For at that place
there were no berries of a certain kind, of which I see you have
plenty in this country.&nbsp; The medicine here will be
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will let you go down river,&rdquo; said Makamuk;
&ldquo;and the sled and the dogs and the six hunters to give you
safety shall be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are slow,&rdquo; was the cool rejoinder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have committed an offence against my medicine in that
you did not at once accept my terms.&nbsp; Behold, I now demand
more.&nbsp; I want one hundred beaver skins.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Makamuk sneered.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want one hundred pounds of dried fish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Makamuk nodded, for fish were plentiful and cheap.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want two sleds&mdash;one for me and one for my furs and
fish.&nbsp; And my rifle must be returned to me.&nbsp; If you do
not like the price, in a little while the price will
grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yakaga whispered to the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I know your medicine is true
medicine?&rdquo; Makamuk asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very easy.&nbsp; First, I shall go into the
woods&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Yakaga whispered to Makamuk, who made a suspicious
dissent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can send twenty hunters with me,&rdquo; Subienkow
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I must get the berries and the
roots with which to make the medicine.&nbsp; Then, when you have
brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and the beaver
skins and the rifle, and when you have told off the six hunters
who will go with me&mdash;then, when all is ready, I will rub the
medicine on my neck, so, and lay my neck there on that log.&nbsp;
Then can your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three
times on my neck.&nbsp; You yourself can strike the three
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Makamuk stood with gaping mouth, drinking in this latest and
most wonderful magic of the fur-thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; the Pole added hastily,
&ldquo;between each blow I must put on fresh medicine.&nbsp; The
axe is heavy and sharp, and I want no mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that you have asked shall be yours,&rdquo; Makamuk
cried in a rush of acceptance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Proceed to make your
medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subienkow concealed his elation.&nbsp; He was playing a
desperate game, and there must be no slips.&nbsp; He spoke
arrogantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been slow.&nbsp; My medicine is
offended.&nbsp; To make the offence clean you must give me your
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the girl, an unwholesome creature, with a cast
in one eye and a bristling wolf-tooth.&nbsp; Makamuk was angry,
but the Pole remained imperturbable, rolling and lighting another
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; he threatened.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
are not quick, I shall demand yet more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, the dreary northland scene faded
before him, and he saw once more his native land, and France,
and, once, as he glanced at the wolf-toothed girl, he remembered
another girl, a singer and a dancer, whom he had known when first
as a youth he came to Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with the girl?&rdquo; Makamuk
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go down the river with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Subienkow
glanced over her critically.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will make a good
wife, and it is an honour worthy of my medicine to be married to
your blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he remembered the singer and dancer and hummed aloud a
song she had taught him.&nbsp; He lived the old life over, but in
a detached, impersonal sort of way, looking at the
memory-pictures of his own life as if they were pictures in a
book of anybody&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The chief&rsquo;s voice,
abruptly breaking the silence, startled him</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; said Makamuk.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
girl shall go down the river with you.&nbsp; But be it understood
that I myself strike the three blows with the axe on your
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But each time I shall put on the medicine,&rdquo;
Subienkow answered, with a show of ill-concealed anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall put the medicine on between each blow.&nbsp;
Here are the hunters who shall see you do not escape.&nbsp; Go
into the forest and gather your medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Makamuk had been convinced of the worth of the medicine by the
Pole&rsquo;s rapacity.&nbsp; Surely nothing less than the
greatest of medicines could enable a man in the shadow of death
to stand up and drive an old-woman&rsquo;s bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; whispered Yakaga, when the Pole, with
his guard, had disappeared among the spruce trees, &ldquo;when
you have learned the medicine you can easily destroy
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I destroy him?&rdquo; Makamuk argued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His medicine will not let me destroy him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be some part where he has not rubbed the
medicine,&rdquo; was Yakaga&rsquo;s reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will
destroy him through that part.&nbsp; It may be his ears.&nbsp;
Very well; we will thrust a spear in one ear and out the
other.&nbsp; Or it may be his eyes.&nbsp; Surely the medicine
will be much too strong to rub on his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are wise, Yakaga.&nbsp; If
he possesses no other devil-things, we will then destroy
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subienkow did not waste time in gathering the ingredients for
his medicine, he selected whatsoever came to hand such as spruce
needles, the inner bark of the willow, a strip of birch bark, and
a quantity of moss-berries, which he made the hunters dig up for
him from beneath the snow.&nbsp; A few frozen roots completed his
supply, and he led the way back to camp.</p>
<p>Makamuk and Yakaga crouched beside him, noting the quantities
and kinds of the ingredients he dropped into the pot of boiling
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be careful that the moss-berries go in
first,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;oh, yes, one other thing&mdash;the finger of
a man.&nbsp; Here, Yakaga, let me cut off your finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Yakaga put his hands behind him and scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a small finger,&rdquo; Subienkow pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yakaga, give him your finger,&rdquo; Makamuk
commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be plenty of fingers lying around,&rdquo; Yakaga
grunted, indicating the human wreckage in the snow of the score
of persons who had been tortured to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the finger of a live man,&rdquo; the Pole
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall you have the finger of a live
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yakaga strode over to the Cossack and sliced
off a finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not yet dead,&rdquo; he announced, flinging the
bloody trophy in the snow at the Pole&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Also, it is a good finger, because it is large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subienkow dropped it into the fire under the pot and began to
sing.&nbsp; It was a French love-song that with great solemnity
he sang into the brew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without these words I utter into it, the medicine is
worthless,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;The words are the
chiefest strength of it.&nbsp; Behold, it is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name the words slowly, that I may know them,&rdquo;
Makamuk commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until after the test.&nbsp; When the axe flies back
three times from my neck, then will I give you the secret of the
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the medicine is not good medicine?&rdquo;
Makamuk queried anxiously.</p>
<p>Subienkow turned upon him wrathfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My medicine is always good.&nbsp; However, if it is not
good, then do by me as you have done to the others.&nbsp; Cut me
up a bit at a time, even as you have cut him up.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
pointed to the Cossack.&nbsp; &ldquo;The medicine is now
cool.&nbsp; Thus, I rub it on my neck, saying this further
medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great gravity he slowly intoned a line of the
&ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; at the same time rubbing the
villainous brew thoroughly into his neck.</p>
<p>An outcry interrupted his play-acting.&nbsp; The giant
Cossack, with a last resurgence of his tremendous vitality, had
arisen to his knees.&nbsp; Laughter and cries of surprise and
applause arose from the Nulatos, as Big Ivan began flinging
himself about in the snow with mighty spasms.</p>
<p>Subienkow was made sick by the sight, but he mastered his
qualms and made believe to be angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Finish
him, and then we will make the test.&nbsp; Here, you, Yakaga, see
that his noise ceases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was being done, Subienkow turned to Makamuk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember, you are to strike hard.&nbsp; This is not
baby-work.&nbsp; Here, take the axe and strike the log, so that I
can see you strike like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Makamuk obeyed, striking twice, precisely and with vigour,
cutting out a large chip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Subienkow looked about him at
the circle of savage faces that somehow seemed to symbolize the
wall of savagery that had hemmed him about ever since the
Czar&rsquo;s police had first arrested him in Warsaw.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take your axe, Makamuk, and stand so.&nbsp; I shall lie
down.&nbsp; When I raise my hand, strike, and strike with all
your might.&nbsp; And be careful that no one stands behind
you.&nbsp; The medicine is good, and the axe may bounce from off
my neck and right out of your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the two sleds, with the dogs in harness, loaded
with furs and fish.&nbsp; His rifle lay on top of the beaver
skins.&nbsp; The six hunters who were to act as his guard stood
by the sleds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the girl?&rdquo; the Pole demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bring her up to the sleds before the test goes
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this had been carried out, Subienkow lay down in the
snow, resting his head on the log like a tired child about to
sleep.&nbsp; He had lived so many dreary years that he was indeed
tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laugh at you and your strength, O Makamuk,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strike, and strike hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his hand.&nbsp; Makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe
for the squaring of logs.&nbsp; The bright steel flashed through
the frosty air, poised for a perceptible instant above
Makamuk&rsquo;s head, then descended upon Subienkow&rsquo;s bare
neck.&nbsp; Clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting
deeply into the log beneath.&nbsp; The amazed savages saw the
head bounce a yard away from the blood-spouting trunk.</p>
<p>There was a great bewilderment and silence, while slowly it
began to dawn in their minds that there had been no
medicine.&nbsp; The fur-thief had outwitted them.&nbsp; Alone, of
all their prisoners, he had escaped the torture.&nbsp; That had
been the stake for which he played.&nbsp; A great roar of
laughter went up.&nbsp; Makamuk bowed his head in shame.&nbsp;
The fur-thief had fooled him.&nbsp; He had lost face before all
his people.&nbsp; Still they continued to roar out their
laughter.&nbsp; Makamuk turned, and with bowed head stalked
away.&nbsp; He knew that thenceforth he would be no longer known
as Makamuk.&nbsp; He would be Lost Face; the record of his shame
would be with him until he died; and whenever the tribes gathered
in the spring for the salmon, or in the summer for the trading,
the story would pass back and forth across the camp-fires of how
the fur-thief died peaceably, at a single stroke, by the hand of
Lost Face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was Lost Face?&rdquo; he could hear, in
anticipation, some insolent young buck demand, &ldquo;Oh, Lost
Face,&rdquo; would be the answer, &ldquo;he who once was Makamuk
in the days before he cut off the fur-thief&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>TRUST</h2>
<p>All lines had been cast off, and the <i>Seattle No.</i> 4 was
pulling slowly out from the shore.&nbsp; Her decks were piled
high with freight and baggage, and swarmed with a heterogeneous
company of Indians, dogs, and dog-mushers, prospectors, traders,
and homeward-bound gold-seekers.&nbsp; A goodly portion of Dawson
was lined up on the bank, saying good-bye.&nbsp; As the
gang-plank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream, the
clamour of farewell became deafening.&nbsp; Also, in that
eleventh moment, everybody began to remember final farewell
messages and to shout them back and forth across the widening
stretch of water.&nbsp; Louis Bondell, curling his yellow
moustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to
his friends on shore, suddenly remembered something and sprang to
the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fred!&rdquo; he bawled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Fred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Fred&rdquo; desired thrust a strapping pair of
shoulders through the forefront of the crowd on the bank and
tried to catch Louis Bondell&rsquo;s message.&nbsp; The latter
grew red in the face with vain vociferation.&nbsp; Still the
water widened between steamboat and shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you, Captain Scott!&rdquo; he yelled at the
pilot-house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop the boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gongs clanged, and the big stern wheel reversed, then
stopped.&nbsp; All hands on steamboat and on bank took advantage
of this respite to exchange final, new, and imperative
farewells.&nbsp; More futile than ever was Louis Bondell&rsquo;s
effort to make himself heard.&nbsp; The <i>Seattle No.</i> 4 lost
way and drifted down-stream, and Captain Scott had to go ahead
and reverse a second time.&nbsp; His head disappeared inside the
pilot-house, coming into view a moment later behind a big
megaphone.</p>
<p>Now Captain Scott had a remarkable voice, and the &ldquo;Shut
up!&rdquo; he launched at the crowd on deck and on shore could
have been heard at the top of Moosehide Mountain and as far as
Klondike City.&nbsp; This official remonstrance from the
pilot-house spread a film of silence over the tumult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you want to say?&rdquo; Captain Scott
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Fred Churchill&mdash;he&rsquo;s on the bank
there&mdash;tell him to go to Macdonald.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in his
safe&mdash;a small gripsack of mine.&nbsp; Tell him to get it and
bring it out when he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the silence Captain Scott bellowed the message ashore
through the megaphone:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Fred Churchill, go to Macdonald&mdash;in his
safe&mdash;small gripsack&mdash;belongs to Louis
Bondell&mdash;important!&nbsp; Bring it out when you come!&nbsp;
Got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it.&nbsp; In
truth, had Macdonald, half a mile away, opened his window,
he&rsquo;d have got it, too.&nbsp; The tumult of farewell rose
again, the gongs clanged, and the <i>Seattle No.</i> 4 went
ahead, swung out into the stream, turned on her heel, and headed
down the Yukon, Bondell and Churchill waving farewell and mutual
affection to the last.</p>
<p>That was in midsummer.&nbsp; In the fall of the year, the
<i>W. H. Willis</i> started up the Yukon with two hundred
homeward-bound pilgrims on board.&nbsp; Among them was
Churchill.&nbsp; In his state-room, in the middle of a
clothes-bag, was Louis Bondell&rsquo;s grip.&nbsp; It was a
small, stout leather affair, and its weight of forty pounds
always made Churchill nervous when he wandered too far from
it.&nbsp; The man in the adjoining state-room had a treasure of
gold-dust hidden similarly in a clothes-bag, and the pair of them
ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch.&nbsp; While one
went down to eat, the other kept an eye on the two state-room
doors.&nbsp; When Churchill wanted to take a hand at whist, the
other man mounted guard, and when the other man wanted to relax
his soul, Churchill read four-months&rsquo; old newspapers on a
camp stool between the two doors.</p>
<p>There were signs of an early winter, and the question that was
discussed from dawn till dark, and far into the dark, was whether
they would get out before the freeze-up or be compelled to
abandon the steamboat and tramp out over the ice.&nbsp; There
were irritating delays.&nbsp; Twice the engines broke down and
had to be tinkered up, and each time there were snow flurries to
warn them of the imminence of winter.&nbsp; Nine times the <i>W.
H. Willis</i> essayed to ascend the Five-Finger Rapids with her
impaired machinery, and when she succeeded, she was four days
behind her very liberal schedule.&nbsp; The question that then
arose was whether or not the steamboat <i>Flora</i> would wait
for her above the Box Ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; The stretch of water
between the head of the Box Ca&ntilde;on and the foot of the
White Horse Rapids was unnavigable for steamboats, and passengers
were transhipped at that point, walking around the rapids from
one steamboat to the other.&nbsp; There were no telephones in the
country, hence no way of informing the waiting <i>Flora</i> that
the <i>Willis</i> was four days late, but coming.</p>
<p>When the <i>W. H. Willis</i> pulled into White Horse, it was
learned that the <i>Flora</i> had waited three days over the
limit, and had departed only a few hours before.&nbsp; Also, it
was learned that she would tie up at Tagish Post till nine
o&rsquo;clock, Sunday morning.&nbsp; It was then four
o&rsquo;clock, Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; The pilgrims called a
meeting.&nbsp; On board was a large Peterborough canoe, consigned
to the police post at the head of Lake Bennett.&nbsp; They agreed
to be responsible for it and to deliver it.&nbsp; Next, they
called for volunteers.&nbsp; Two men were needed to make a race
for the <i>Flora</i>.&nbsp; A score of men volunteered on the
instant.&nbsp; Among them was Churchill, such being his nature
that he volunteered before he thought of Bondell&rsquo;s
gripsack.&nbsp; When this thought came to him, he began to hope
that he would not be selected; but a man who had made a name as
captain of a college football eleven, as a president of an
athletic club, as a dog-musher and a stampeder in the Yukon, and,
moreover, who possessed such shoulders as he, had no right to
avoid the honour.&nbsp; It was thrust upon him and upon a
gigantic German, Nick Antonsen.</p>
<p>While a crowd of the pilgrims, the canoe on their shoulders,
started on a trot over the portage, Churchill ran to his
state-room.&nbsp; He turned the contents of the clothes-bag on
the floor and caught up the grip, with the intention of
entrusting it to the man next door.&nbsp; Then the thought smote
him that it was not his grip, and that he had no right to let it
out of his possession.&nbsp; So he dashed ashore with it and ran
up the portage changing it often from one hand to the other, and
wondering if it really did not weigh more than forty pounds.</p>
<p>It was half-past four in the afternoon when the two men
started.&nbsp; The current of the Thirty Mile River was so strong
that rarely could they use the paddles.&nbsp; It was out on one
bank with a tow-line over the shoulders, stumbling over the
rocks, forcing a way through the underbrush, slipping at times
and falling into the water, wading often up to the knees and
waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was encountered, it
was into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing dash
across the current to the other bank, in paddles, over the side,
and out tow-line again.&nbsp; It was exhausting work.&nbsp;
Antonsen toiled like the giant he was, uncomplaining, persistent,
but driven to his utmost by the powerful body and indomitable
brain of Churchill.&nbsp; They never paused for rest.&nbsp; It
was go, go, and keep on going.&nbsp; A crisp wind blew down the
river, freezing their hands and making it imperative, from time
to time, to beat the blood back into the numbed fingers.</p>
<p>As night came on, they were compelled to trust to luck.&nbsp;
They fell repeatedly on the untravelled banks and tore their
clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not see.&nbsp;
Both men were badly scratched and bleeding.&nbsp; A dozen times,
in their wild dashes from bank to bank, they struck snags and
were capsized.&nbsp; The first time this happened, Churchill
dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack.&nbsp;
He lost half an hour in recovering it, and after that it was
carried securely lashed to the canoe.&nbsp; As long as the canoe
floated it was safe.&nbsp; Antonsen jeered at the grip, and
toward morning began to curse it; but Churchill vouchsafed no
explanations.</p>
<p>Their delays and mischances were endless.&nbsp; On one swift
bend, around which poured a healthy young rapid, they lost two
hours, making a score of attempts and capsizing twice.&nbsp; At
this point, on both banks, were precipitous bluffs, rising out of
deep water, and along which they could neither tow nor pole,
while they could not gain with the paddles against the
current.&nbsp; At each attempt they strained to the utmost with
the paddles, and each time, with heads nigh to bursting from the
effort, they were played out and swept back.&nbsp; They succeeded
finally by an accident.&nbsp; In the swiftest current, near the
end of another failure, a freak of the current sheered the canoe
out of Churchill&rsquo;s control and flung it against the
bluff.&nbsp; Churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and landed
in a crevice.&nbsp; Holding on with one hand, he held the swamped
canoe with the other till Antonsen dragged himself out of the
water.&nbsp; Then they pulled the canoe out and rested.&nbsp; A
fresh start at this crucial point took them by.&nbsp; They landed
on the bank above and plunged immediately ashore and into the
brush with the tow-line.</p>
<p>Daylight found them far below Tagish Post.&nbsp; At nine
o&rsquo;clock Sunday morning they could hear the <i>Flora</i>
whistling her departure.&nbsp; And when, at ten o&rsquo;clock,
they dragged themselves in to the Post, they could barely see the
<i>Flora&rsquo;s</i> smoke far to the southward.&nbsp; It was a
pair of worn-out tatterdemalions that Captain Jones of the
Mounted Police welcomed and fed, and he afterward averred that
they possessed two of the most tremendous appetites he had ever
observed.&nbsp; They lay down and slept in their wet rags by the
stove.&nbsp; At the end of two hours Churchill got up, carried
Bondell&rsquo;s grip, which he had used for a pillow, down to the
canoe, kicked Antonsen awake, and started in pursuit of the
<i>Flora</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what might
happen&mdash;machinery break down, or something,&rdquo; was his
reply to Captain Jones&rsquo;s expostulations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to catch that steamer and send her back
for the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tagish Lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their
teeth.&nbsp; Big, swinging seas rushed upon the canoe, compelling
one man to bale and leaving one man to paddle.&nbsp; Headway
could not be made.&nbsp; They ran along the shallow shore and
went overboard, one man ahead on the tow-line, the other shoving
on the canoe.&nbsp; They fought the gale up to their waists in
the icy water, often up to their necks, often over their heads
and buried by the big, crested waves.&nbsp; There was no rest,
never a moment&rsquo;s pause from the cheerless, heart-breaking
battle.&nbsp; That night, at the head of Tagish Lake, in the
thick of a driving snow-squall, they overhauled the
<i>Flora</i>.&nbsp; Antonsen fell on board, lay where he had
fallen, and snored.&nbsp; Churchill looked like a wild man.&nbsp;
His clothes barely clung to him.&nbsp; His face was iced up and
swollen from the protracted effort of twenty-four hours, while
his hands were so swollen that he could not close the
fingers.&nbsp; As for his feet, it was an agony to stand upon
them.</p>
<p>The captain of the <i>Flora</i> was loth to go back to White
Horse.&nbsp; Churchill was persistent and imperative; the captain
was stubborn.&nbsp; He pointed out finally that nothing was to be
gained by going back, because the only ocean steamer at Dyea, the
<i>Athenian</i>, was to sail on Tuesday morning, and that he
could not make the back trip to White Horse and bring up the
stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time does the <i>Athenian</i> sail?&rdquo;
Churchill demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock, Tuesday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Churchill said, at the same time
kicking a tattoo on the ribs of the snoring Antonsen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You go back to White Home.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go ahead and
hold the <i>Athenian</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antonsen, stupid with sleep, not yet clothed in his waking
mind, was bundled into the canoe, and did not realize what had
happened till he was drenched with the icy spray of a big sea,
and heard Churchill snarling at him through the
darkness:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddle, can&rsquo;t you!&nbsp; Do you want to be
swamped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daylight found them at Caribou Crossing, the wind dying down,
and Antonsen too far gone to dip a paddle.&nbsp; Churchill
grounded the canoe on a quiet beach, where they slept.&nbsp; He
took the precaution of twisting his arm under the weight of his
head.&nbsp; Every few minutes the pain of the pent circulation
aroused him, whereupon he would look at his watch and twist the
other arm under his head.&nbsp; At the end of two hours he fought
with Antonsen to rouse him.&nbsp; Then they started.&nbsp; Lake
Bennett, thirty miles in length, was like a millpond; but, half
way across, a gale from the south smote them and turned the water
white.&nbsp; Hour after hour they repeated the struggle on
Tagish, over the side, pulling and shoving on the canoe, up to
their waists and necks, and over their heads, in the icy water;
toward the last the good-natured giant played completely
out.&nbsp; Churchill drove him mercilessly; but when he pitched
forward and bade fair to drown in three feet of water, the other
dragged him into the canoe.&nbsp; After that, Churchill fought on
alone, arriving at the police post at the head of Bennett in the
early afternoon.&nbsp; He tried to help Antonsen out of the
canoe, but failed.&nbsp; He listened to the exhausted man&rsquo;s
heavy breathing, and envied him when he thought of what he
himself had yet to undergo.&nbsp; Antonsen could lie there and
sleep; but he, behind time, must go on over mighty Chilcoot and
down to the sea.&nbsp; The real struggle lay before him, and he
almost regretted the strength that resided in his frame because
of the torment it could inflict upon that frame.</p>
<p>Churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach, seized
Bondell&rsquo;s grip, and started on a limping dog-trot for the
police post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a canoe down there, consigned to you from
Dawson,&rdquo; he hurled at the officer who answered his
knock.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a man in it pretty near
dead.&nbsp; Nothing serious; only played out.&nbsp; Take care of
him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to rush.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; Want to
catch the <i>Athenian</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mile portage connected Lake Bennett and Lake Linderman, and
his last words he flung back after him as he resumed the
trot.&nbsp; It was a very painful trot, but he clenched his teeth
and kept on, forgetting his pain most of the time in the fervent
heat with which he regarded the gripsack.&nbsp; It was a severe
handicap.&nbsp; He swung it from one hand to the other, and back
again.&nbsp; He tucked it under his arm.&nbsp; He threw one hand
over the opposite shoulder, and the bag bumped and pounded on his
back as he ran along.&nbsp; He could scarcely hold it in his
bruised and swollen fingers, and several times he dropped
it.&nbsp; Once, in changing from one hand to the other, it
escaped his clutch and fell in front of him, tripped him up, and
threw him violently to the ground.</p>
<p>At the far end of the portage he bought an old set of
pack-straps for a dollar, and in them he swung the grip.&nbsp;
Also, he chartered a launch to run him the six miles to the upper
end of Lake Linderman, where he arrived at four in the
afternoon.&nbsp; The <i>Athenian</i> was to sail from Dyea next
morning at seven.&nbsp; Dyea was twenty-eight miles away, and
between towered Chilcoot.&nbsp; He sat down to adjust his
foot-gear for the long climb, and woke up.&nbsp; He had dozed the
instant he sat down, though he had not slept thirty
seconds.&nbsp; He was afraid his next doze might be longer, so he
finished fixing his foot-gear standing up.&nbsp; Even then he was
overpowered for a fleeting moment.&nbsp; He experienced the flash
of unconsciousness; becoming aware of it, in mid-air, as his
relaxed body was sinking to the ground and as he caught himself
together, he stiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench, and
escaped the fall.&nbsp; The sudden jerk back to consciousness
left him sick and trembling.&nbsp; He beat his head with the heel
of his hand, knocking wakefulness into the numbed brain.</p>
<p>Jack Burns&rsquo;s pack-train was starting back light for
Crater Lake, and Churchill was invited to a mule.&nbsp; Burns
wanted to put the gripsack on another animal, but Churchill held
on to it, carrying it on his saddle-pommel.&nbsp; But he dozed,
and the grip persisted in dropping off the pommel, one side or
the other, each time wakening him with a sickening start.&nbsp;
Then, in the early darkness, Churchill&rsquo;s mule brushed him
against a projecting branch that laid his cheek open.&nbsp; To
cap it, the mule blundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider
and gripsack out upon the rocks.&nbsp; After that, Churchill
walked, or stumbled rather, over the apology for a trail, leading
the mule.&nbsp; Stray and awful odours, drifting from each side
of the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush for
gold.&nbsp; But he did not mind.&nbsp; He was too sleepy.&nbsp;
By the time Long Lake was reached, however, he had recovered from
his sleepiness; and at Deep Lake he resigned the gripsack to
Burns.&nbsp; But thereafter, by the light of the dim stars, he
kept his eyes on Burns.&nbsp; There were not going to be any
accidents with that bag.</p>
<p>At Crater Lake, the pack-train went into camp, and Churchill,
slinging the grip on his back, started the steep climb for the
summit.&nbsp; For the first time, on that precipitous wall, he
realized how tired he was.&nbsp; He crept and crawled like a
crab, burdened by the weight of his limbs.&nbsp; A distinct and
painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a
foot.&nbsp; An hallucination came to him that he was shod with
lead, like a deep-sea diver, and it was all he could do to resist
the desire to reach down and feel the lead.&nbsp; As for
Bondell&rsquo;s gripsack, it was inconceivable that forty pounds
could weigh so much.&nbsp; It pressed him down like a mountain,
and he looked back with unbelief to the year before, when he had
climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his
back.&nbsp; If those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty
pounds, then Bondell&rsquo;s grip weighed five hundred.</p>
<p>The first rise of the divide from Crater Lake was across a
small glacier.&nbsp; Here was a well-defined trail.&nbsp; But
above the glacier, which was also above timber-line, was naught
but a chaos of naked rock and enormous boulders.&nbsp; There was
no way of seeing the trail in the darkness, and he blundered on,
paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he
accomplished.&nbsp; He won the summit in the thick of howling
wind and driving snow, providentially stumbling upon a small,
deserted tent, into which he crawled.&nbsp; There he found and
bolted some ancient fried potatoes and half a dozen raw eggs.</p>
<p>When the snow ceased and the wind eased down, he began the
almost impossible descent.&nbsp; There was no trail, and he
stumbled and blundered, often finding himself, at the last
moment, on the edge of rocky walls and steep slopes the depth of
which he had no way of judging.&nbsp; Part way down, the stars
clouded over again, and in the consequent obscurity he slipped
and rolled and slid for a hundred feet, landing bruised and
bleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole.&nbsp; From all
about him arose the stench of dead horses.&nbsp; The hole was
handy to the trail, and the packers had made a practice of
tumbling into it their broken and dying animals.&nbsp; The stench
overpowered him, making him deadly sick, and as in a nightmare he
scrambled out.&nbsp; Half-way up, he recollected Bondell&rsquo;s
gripsack.&nbsp; It had fallen into the hole with him; the
pack-strap had evidently broken, and he had forgotten it.&nbsp;
Back he went into the pestilential charnel-pit, where he crawled
around on hands and knees and groped for half an hour.&nbsp;
Altogether he encountered and counted seventeen dead horses (and
one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver) before he
found Bondell&rsquo;s grip.&nbsp; Looking back upon a life that
had not been without valour and achievement, he unhesitatingly
declared to himself that this return after the grip was the most
heroic act he had ever performed.&nbsp; So heroic was it that he
was twice on the verge of fainting before he crawled out of the
hole.</p>
<p>By the time he had descended to the Scales, the steep pitch of
Chilcoot was past, and the way became easier.&nbsp; Not that it
was an easy way, however, in the best of places; but it became a
really possible trail, along which he could have made good time
if he had not been worn out, if he had had light with which to
pick his steps, and if it had not been for Bondell&rsquo;s
gripsack.&nbsp; To him, in his exhausted condition, it was the
last straw.&nbsp; Having barely strength to carry himself along,
the additional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him
nearly every time he tripped or stumbled.&nbsp; And when he
escaped tripping, branches reached out in the darkness, hooked
the grip between his shoulders, and held him back.</p>
<p>His mind was made up that if he missed the <i>Athenian</i> it
would be the fault of the gripsack.&nbsp; In fact, only two
things remained in his consciousness&mdash;Bondell&rsquo;s grip
and the steamer.&nbsp; He knew only those two things, and they
became identified, in a way, with some stern mission upon which
he had journeyed and toiled for centuries.&nbsp; He walked and
struggled on as in a dream.&nbsp; As part of the dream was his
arrival at Sheep Camp.&nbsp; He stumbled into a saloon, slid his
shoulders out of the straps, and started to deposit the grip at
his feet.&nbsp; But it slipped from his fingers and struck the
floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed by two men who
were just leaving.&nbsp; Churchill drank a glass of whisky, told
the barkeeper to call him in ten minutes, and sat down, his feet
on the grip, his head on his knees.</p>
<p>So badly did his misused body stiffen, that when he was called
it required another ten minutes and a second glass of whisky to
unbend his joints and limber up the muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey not that way!&rdquo; the barkeeper shouted, and
then went after him and started him through the darkness toward
Canyon City.&nbsp; Some little husk of inner consciousness told
Churchill that the direction was right, and, still as in a dream,
he took the ca&ntilde;on trail.&nbsp; He did not know what warned
him, but after what seemed several centuries of travelling, he
sensed danger and drew his revolver.&nbsp; Still in the dream, he
saw two men step out and heard them halt him.&nbsp; His revolver
went off four times, and he saw the flashes and heard the
explosions of their revolvers.&nbsp; Also, he was aware that he
had been hit in the thigh.&nbsp; He saw one man go down, and, as
the other came for him, he smashed him a straight blow with the
heavy revolver full in the face.&nbsp; Then he turned and
ran.&nbsp; He came from the dream shortly afterward, to find
himself plunging down the trail at a limping lope.&nbsp; His
first thought was for the gripsack.&nbsp; It was still on his
back.&nbsp; He was convinced that what had happened was a dream
till he felt for his revolver and found it gone.&nbsp; Next he
became aware of a sharp stinging of his thigh, and after
investigating, he found his hand warm with blood.&nbsp; It was a
superficial wound, but it was incontestable.&nbsp; He became
wider awake, and kept up the lumbering run to Canyon City.</p>
<p>He found a man, with a team of horses and a wagon, who got out
of bed and harnessed up for twenty dollars.&nbsp; Churchill
crawled in on the wagon-bed and slept, the gripsack still on his
back.&nbsp; It was a rough ride, over water-washed boulders down
the Dyea Valley; but he roused only when the wagon hit the
highest places.&nbsp; Any altitude of his body above the
wagon-bed of less than a foot did not faze him.&nbsp; The last
mile was smooth going, and he slept soundly.</p>
<p>He came to in the grey dawn, the driver shaking him savagely
and howling into his ear that the <i>Athenian</i> was gone.&nbsp;
Churchill looked blankly at the deserted harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a smoke over at Skaguay,&rdquo; the man
said.</p>
<p>Churchill&rsquo;s eyes were too swollen to see that far, but
he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s she.&nbsp; Get me a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver was obliging and found a skiff, and a man to row it
for ten dollars, payment in advance.&nbsp; Churchill paid, and
was helped into the skiff.&nbsp; It was beyond him to get in by
himself.&nbsp; It was six miles to Skaguay, and he had a blissful
thought of sleeping those six miles.&nbsp; But the man did not
know how to row, and Churchill took the oars and toiled for a few
more centuries.&nbsp; He never knew six longer and more
excruciating miles.&nbsp; A snappy little breeze blew up the
inlet and held him back.&nbsp; He had a gone feeling at the pit
of the stomach, and suffered from faintness and numbness.&nbsp;
At his command, the man took the baler and threw salt water into
his face.</p>
<p>The <i>Athenian&rsquo;s</i> anchor was up-and-down when they
came alongside, and Churchill was at the end of his last remnant
of strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop her!&nbsp; Stop her!&rdquo; he shouted
hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Important message!&nbsp; Stop her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he dropped his chin on his chest and slept.&nbsp; When
half a dozen men started to carry him up the gang-plank, he
awoke, reached for the grip, and clung to it like a drowning
man.</p>
<p>On deck he became a centre of horror and curiosity.&nbsp; The
clothing in which he had left White Horse was represented by a
few rags, and he was as frayed as his clothing.&nbsp; He had
travelled for fifty-five hours at the top notch of
endurance.&nbsp; He had slept six hours in that time, and he was
twenty pounds lighter than when he started.&nbsp; Face and hands
and body were scratched and bruised, and he could scarcely
see.&nbsp; He tried to stand up, but failed, sprawling out on the
deck, hanging on to the gripsack, and delivering his message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, put me to bed,&rdquo; he finished;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat when I wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did him honour, carrying him down in his rags and dirt
and depositing him and Bondell&rsquo;s grip in the bridal
chamber, which was the biggest and most luxurious state-room in
the ship.&nbsp; Twice he slept the clock around, and he had
bathed and shaved and eaten and was leaning over the rail smoking
a cigar when the two hundred pilgrims from White Horse came
alongside.</p>
<p>By the time the <i>Athenian</i> arrived in Seattle, Churchill
had fully recuperated, and he went ashore with Bondell&rsquo;s
grip in his hand.&nbsp; He felt proud of that grip.&nbsp; To him
it stood for achievement and integrity and trust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve delivered the goods,&rdquo; was the way he
expressed these various high terms to himself.&nbsp; It was early
in the evening, and he went straight to Bondell&rsquo;s
home.&nbsp; Louis Bondell was glad to see him, shaking hands with
both hands at the same time and dragging him into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks, old man; it was good of you to bring it
out,&rdquo; Bondell said when he received the gripsack.</p>
<p>He tossed it carelessly upon a couch, and Churchill noted with
an appreciative eye the rebound of its weight from the
springs.&nbsp; Bondell was volleying him with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you make out?&nbsp; How&rsquo;re the
boys?&nbsp; What became of Bill Smithers?&nbsp; Is Del Bishop
still with Pierce?&nbsp; Did he sell my dogs?&nbsp; How did
Sulphur Bottom show up?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re looking fine.&nbsp;
What steamer did you come out on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all of which Churchill gave answer, till half an hour had
gone by and the first lull in the conversation had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better take a look at it?&rdquo; he
suggested, nodding his head at the gripsack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Bondell
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did Mitchell&rsquo;s dump turn out as much
as he expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better look at it,&rdquo; Churchill
insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I deliver a thing, I want to be
satisfied that it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s always
the chance that somebody might have got into it when I was
asleep, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing important, old man,&rdquo; Bondell
answered, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing important,&rdquo; Churchill echoed in a faint,
small voice.&nbsp; Then he spoke with decision: &ldquo;Louis,
what&rsquo;s in that bag?&nbsp; I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis looked at him curiously, then left the room and returned
with a bunch of keys.&nbsp; He inserted his hand and drew out a
heavy Colt&rsquo;s revolver.&nbsp; Next came out a few boxes of
ammunition for the revolver and several boxes of Winchester
cartridges.</p>
<p>Churchill took the gripsack and looked into it.&nbsp; Then he
turned it upside down and shook it gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gun&rsquo;s all rusted,&rdquo; Bondell said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Must have been out in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Churchill answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too bad it
got wet.&nbsp; I guess I was a bit careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up and went outside.&nbsp; Ten minutes later Louis
Bondell went out and found him on the steps, sitting down, elbows
on knees and chin on hands, gazing steadfastly out into the
darkness.</p>
<h2>TO BUILD A FIRE</h2>
<p>Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when
the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the
high earth-bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led
eastward through the fat spruce timberland.&nbsp; It was a steep
bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to
himself by looking at his watch.&nbsp; It was nine
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There was no sun nor hint of sun, though
there was not a cloud in the sky.&nbsp; It was a clear day, and
yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a
subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the
absence of sun.&nbsp; This fact did not worry the man.&nbsp; He
was used to the lack of sun.&nbsp; It had been days since he had
seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before
that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky-line
and dip immediately from view.</p>
<p>The man flung a look back along the way he had come.&nbsp; The
Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice.&nbsp;
On top of this ice were as many feet of snow.&nbsp; It was all
pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of
the freeze-up had formed.&nbsp; North and south, as far as his
eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line
that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to
the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where
it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island.&nbsp; This
dark hair-line was the trail&mdash;the main trail&mdash;that led
south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt
water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on
to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St.
Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand
more.</p>
<p>But all this&mdash;the mysterious, far-reaching hairline
trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and
the strangeness and weirdness of it all&mdash;made no impression
on the man.&nbsp; It was not because he was long used to
it.&nbsp; He was a new-comer in the land, a <i>chechaquo</i>, and
this was his first winter.&nbsp; The trouble with him was that he
was without imagination.&nbsp; He was quick and alert in the
things of life, but only in the things, and not in the
significances.&nbsp; Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd
degrees of frost.&nbsp; Such fact impressed him as being cold and
uncomfortable, and that was all.&nbsp; It did not lead him to
meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon
man&rsquo;s frailty in general, able only to live within certain
narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead
him to the conjectural field of immortality and man&rsquo;s place
in the universe.&nbsp; Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite
of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of
mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks.&nbsp; Fifty
degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below
zero.&nbsp; That there should be anything more to it than that
was a thought that never entered his head.</p>
<p>As he turned to go on, he spat speculatively.&nbsp; There was
a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him.&nbsp; He spat
again.&nbsp; And again, in the air, before it could fall to the
snow, the spittle crackled.&nbsp; He knew that at fifty below
spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in
the air.&nbsp; Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty
below&mdash;how much colder he did not know.&nbsp; But the
temperature did not matter.&nbsp; He was bound for the old claim
on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were
already.&nbsp; They had come over across the divide from the
Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to
take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the
spring from the islands in the Yukon.&nbsp; He would be in to
camp by six o&rsquo;clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the
boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper
would be ready.&nbsp; As for lunch, he pressed his hand against
the protruding bundle under his jacket.&nbsp; It was also under
his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the
naked skin.&nbsp; It was the only way to keep the biscuits from
freezing.&nbsp; He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of
those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and
each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.</p>
<p>He plunged in among the big spruce trees.&nbsp; The trail was
faint.&nbsp; A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had
passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling
light.&nbsp; In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in
the handkerchief.&nbsp; He was surprised, however, at the
cold.&nbsp; It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his
numbed nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand.&nbsp; He was
a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect
the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself
aggressively into the frosty air.</p>
<p>At the man&rsquo;s heels trotted a dog, a big native husky,
the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or
temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf.&nbsp;
The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold.&nbsp; It knew
that it was no time for travelling.&nbsp; Its instinct told it a
truer tale than was told to the man by the man&rsquo;s
judgment.&nbsp; In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty
below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy
below.&nbsp; It was seventy-five below zero.&nbsp; Since the
freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one
hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained.&nbsp; The dog did
not know anything about thermometers.&nbsp; Possibly in its brain
there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such
as was in the man&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; But the brute had its
instinct.&nbsp; It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension
that subdued it and made it slink along at the man&rsquo;s heels,
and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the
man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter
somewhere and build a fire.&nbsp; The dog had learned fire, and
it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its
warmth away from the air.</p>
<p>The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in
a fine powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle,
and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath.&nbsp; The
man&rsquo;s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but
more solidly, the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing
with every warm, moist breath he exhaled.&nbsp; Also, the man was
chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly
that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the
juice.&nbsp; The result was that a crystal beard of the colour
and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his
chin.&nbsp; If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass,
into brittle fragments.&nbsp; But he did not mind the
appendage.&nbsp; It was the penalty all tobacco-chewers paid in
that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps.&nbsp;
They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit
thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at
fifty below and at fifty-five.</p>
<p>He held on through the level stretch of woods for several
miles, crossed a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a
bank to the frozen bed of a small stream.&nbsp; This was
Henderson Creek, and he knew he was ten miles from the
forks.&nbsp; He looked at his watch.&nbsp; It was ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He was making four miles an hour, and he
calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past
twelve.&nbsp; He decided to celebrate that event by eating his
lunch there.</p>
<p>The dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping
discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed.&nbsp; The
furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen
inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners.&nbsp; In a
month no man had come up or down that silent creek.&nbsp; The man
held steadily on.&nbsp; He was not much given to thinking, and
just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he
would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o&rsquo;clock he
would be in camp with the boys.&nbsp; There was nobody to talk to
and, had there been, speech would have been impossible because of
the ice-muzzle on his mouth.&nbsp; So he continued monotonously
to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber
beard.</p>
<p>Once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very
cold and that he had never experienced such cold.&nbsp; As he
walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of
his mittened hand.&nbsp; He did this automatically, now and again
changing hands.&nbsp; But rub as he would, the instant he stopped
his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant the end of
his nose went numb.&nbsp; He was sure to frost his cheeks; he
knew that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not
devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps.&nbsp;
Such a strap passed across the cheeks, as well, and saved
them.&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t matter much, after all.&nbsp;
What were frosted cheeks?&nbsp; A bit painful, that was all; they
were never serious.</p>
<p>Empty as the man&rsquo;s mind was of thoughts, he was keenly
observant, and he noticed the changes in the creek, the curves
and bends and timber-jams, and always he sharply noted where he
placed his feet.&nbsp; Once, coming around a bend, he shied
abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from the place where
he had been walking, and retreated several paces back along the
trail.&nbsp; The creek he knew was frozen clear to the
bottom&mdash;no creek could contain water in that arctic
winter&mdash;but he knew also that there were springs that
bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and
on top the ice of the creek.&nbsp; He knew that the coldest snaps
never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their
danger.&nbsp; They were traps.&nbsp; They hid pools of water
under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three
feet.&nbsp; Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered
them, and in turn was covered by the snow.&nbsp; Sometimes there
were alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one
broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes
wetting himself to the waist.</p>
<p>That was why he had shied in such panic.&nbsp; He had felt the
give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden
ice-skin.&nbsp; And to get his feet wet in such a temperature
meant trouble and danger.&nbsp; At the very least it meant delay,
for he would be forced to stop and build a fire, and under its
protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and
moccasins.&nbsp; He stood and studied the creek-bed and its
banks, and decided that the flow of water came from the
right.&nbsp; He reflected awhile, rubbing his nose and cheeks,
then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and testing the
footing for each step.&nbsp; Once clear of the danger, he took a
fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.</p>
<p>In the course of the next two hours he came upon several
similar traps.&nbsp; Usually the snow above the hidden pools had
a sunken, candied appearance that advertised the danger.&nbsp;
Once again, however, he had a close call; and once, suspecting
danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front.&nbsp; The dog did
not want to go.&nbsp; It hung back until the man shoved it
forward, and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken
surface.&nbsp; Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side,
and got away to firmer footing.&nbsp; It had wet its forefeet and
legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to
ice.&nbsp; It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs,
then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that
had formed between the toes.&nbsp; This was a matter of
instinct.&nbsp; To permit the ice to remain would mean sore
feet.&nbsp; It did not know this.&nbsp; It merely obeyed the
mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its
being.&nbsp; But the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the
subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped
tear out the ice-particles.&nbsp; He did not expose his fingers
more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that
smote them.&nbsp; It certainly was cold.&nbsp; He pulled on the
mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock the day was at its brightest.&nbsp;
Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the
horizon.&nbsp; The bulge of the earth intervened between it and
Henderson Creek, where the man walked under a clear sky at noon
and cast no shadow.&nbsp; At half-past twelve, to the minute, he
arrived at the forks of the creek.&nbsp; He was pleased at the
speed he had made.&nbsp; If he kept it up, he would certainly be
with the boys by six.&nbsp; He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt
and drew forth his lunch.&nbsp; The action consumed no more than
a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness laid
hold of the exposed fingers.&nbsp; He did not put the mitten on,
but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against
his leg.&nbsp; Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to
eat.&nbsp; The sting that followed upon the striking of his
fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled,
he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit.&nbsp; He struck
the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten, baring
the other hand for the purpose of eating.&nbsp; He tried to take
a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented.&nbsp; He had forgotten
to build a fire and thaw out.&nbsp; He chuckled at his
foolishness, and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping
into the exposed fingers.&nbsp; Also, he noted that the stinging
which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already
passing away.&nbsp; He wondered whether the toes were warm or
numbed.&nbsp; He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that
they were numbed.</p>
<p>He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up.&nbsp; He was a
bit frightened.&nbsp; He stamped up and down until the stinging
returned into the feet.&nbsp; It certainly was cold, was his
thought.&nbsp; That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth
when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country.&nbsp; And
he had laughed at him at the time!&nbsp; That showed one must not
be too sure of things.&nbsp; There was no mistake about it, it
was cold.&nbsp; He strode up and down, stamping his feet and
threshing his arms, until reassured by the returning
warmth.&nbsp; Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a
fire.&nbsp; From the undergrowth, where high water of the
previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his
firewood.&nbsp; Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon
had a roaring fire, over which he thawed the ice from his face
and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits.&nbsp; For the
moment the cold of space was outwitted.&nbsp; The dog took
satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth
and far enough away to escape being singed.</p>
<p>When the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his
comfortable time over a smoke.&nbsp; Then he pulled on his
mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears,
and took the creek trail up the left fork.&nbsp; The dog was
disappointed and yearned back toward the fire.&nbsp; This man did
not know cold.&nbsp; Possibly all the generations of his ancestry
had been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and
seven degrees below freezing-point.&nbsp; But the dog knew; all
its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge.&nbsp; And
it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful
cold.&nbsp; It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and
wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer
space whence this cold came.&nbsp; On the other hand, there was
keen intimacy between the dog and the man.&nbsp; The one was the
toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever
received were the caresses of the whip-lash and of harsh and
menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash.&nbsp; So
the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the
man.&nbsp; It was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was
for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire.&nbsp; But
the man whistled, and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes,
and the dog swung in at the man&rsquo;s heels and followed
after.</p>
<p>The man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new
amber beard.&nbsp; Also, his moist breath quickly powdered with
white his moustache, eyebrows, and lashes.&nbsp; There did not
seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson, and
for half an hour the man saw no signs of any.&nbsp; And then it
happened.&nbsp; At a place where there were no signs, where the
soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man
broke through.&nbsp; It was not deep.&nbsp; He wetted himself
half-way to the knees before he floundered out to the firm
crust.</p>
<p>He was angry, and cursed his luck aloud.&nbsp; He had hoped to
get into camp with the boys at six o&rsquo;clock, and this would
delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out
his foot-gear.&nbsp; This was imperative at that low
temperature&mdash;he knew that much; and he turned aside to the
bank, which he climbed.&nbsp; On top, tangled in the underbrush
about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water
deposit of dry firewood&mdash;sticks and twigs principally, but
also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry,
last-year&rsquo;s grasses.&nbsp; He threw down several large
pieces on top of the snow.&nbsp; This served for a foundation and
prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it
otherwise would melt.&nbsp; The flame he got by touching a match
to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his
pocket.&nbsp; This burned even more readily than paper.&nbsp;
Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps
of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.</p>
<p>He worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his
danger.&nbsp; Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased
the size of the twigs with which he fed it.&nbsp; He squatted in
the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the
brush and feeding directly to the flame.&nbsp; He knew there must
be no failure.&nbsp; When it is seventy-five below zero, a man
must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire&mdash;that is,
if his feet are wet.&nbsp; If his feet are dry, and he fails, he
can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his
circulation.&nbsp; But the circulation of wet and freezing feet
cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five
below.&nbsp; No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze
the harder.</p>
<p>All this the man knew.&nbsp; The old-timer on Sulphur Creek
had told him about it the previous fall, and now he was
appreciating the advice.&nbsp; Already all sensation had gone out
of his feet.&nbsp; To build the fire he had been forced to remove
his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb.&nbsp; His
pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to
the surface of his body and to all the extremities.&nbsp; But the
instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down.&nbsp; The
cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he,
being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the
blow.&nbsp; The blood of his body recoiled before it.&nbsp; The
blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide
away and cover itself up from the fearful cold.&nbsp; So long as
he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly,
to the surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the
recesses of his body.&nbsp; The extremities were the first to
feel its absence.&nbsp; His wet feet froze the faster, and his
exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun
to freeze.&nbsp; Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the
skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.</p>
<p>But he was safe.&nbsp; Toes and nose and cheeks would be only
touched by the frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with
strength.&nbsp; He was feeding it with twigs the size of his
finger.&nbsp; In another minute he would be able to feed it with
branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove his wet
foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm
by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow.&nbsp;
The fire was a success.&nbsp; He was safe.&nbsp; He remembered
the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled.&nbsp;
The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that
no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below.&nbsp;
Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he
had saved himself.&nbsp; Those old-timers were rather womanish,
some of them, he thought.&nbsp; All a man had to do was to keep
his head, and he was all right.&nbsp; Any man who was a man could
travel alone.&nbsp; But it was surprising, the rapidity with
which his cheeks and nose were freezing.&nbsp; And he had not
thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time.&nbsp;
Lifeless they were, for he could scarcely make them move together
to grip a twig, and they seemed remote from his body and from
him.&nbsp; When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether
or not he had hold of it.&nbsp; The wires were pretty well down
between him and his finger-ends.</p>
<p>All of which counted for little.&nbsp; There was the fire,
snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing
flame.&nbsp; He started to untie his moccasins.&nbsp; They were
coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron
half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings were like rods of
steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration.&nbsp; For
a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the
folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.</p>
<p>But before he could cut the strings, it happened.&nbsp; It was
his own fault or, rather, his mistake.&nbsp; He should not have
built the fire under the spruce tree.&nbsp; He should have built
it in the open.&nbsp; But it had been easier to pull the twigs
from the brush and drop them directly on the fire.&nbsp; Now the
tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its
boughs.&nbsp; No wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was
fully freighted.&nbsp; Each time he had pulled a twig he had
communicated a slight agitation to the tree&mdash;an
imperceptible agitation, so far as he was concerned, but an
agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster.&nbsp; High up
in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow.&nbsp; This fell
on the boughs beneath, capsizing them.&nbsp; This process
continued, spreading out and involving the whole tree.&nbsp; It
grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the
man and the fire, and the fire was blotted out!&nbsp; Where it
had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.</p>
<p>The man was shocked.&nbsp; It was as though he had just heard
his own sentence of death.&nbsp; For a moment he sat and stared
at the spot where the fire had been.&nbsp; Then he grew very
calm.&nbsp; Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was
right.&nbsp; If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been
in no danger now.&nbsp; The trail-mate could have built the
fire.&nbsp; Well, it was up to him to build the fire over again,
and this second time there must be no failure.&nbsp; Even if he
succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes.&nbsp; His feet
must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before
the second fire was ready.</p>
<p>Such were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think
them.&nbsp; He was busy all the time they were passing through
his mind, he made a new foundation for a fire, this time in the
open; where no treacherous tree could blot it out.&nbsp; Next, he
gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water
flotsam.&nbsp; He could not bring his fingers together to pull
them out, but he was able to gather them by the handful.&nbsp; In
this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that
were undesirable, but it was the best he could do.&nbsp; He
worked methodically, even collecting an armful of the larger
branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength.&nbsp;
And all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning
wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the
fire-provider, and the fire was slow in coming.</p>
<p>When all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second
piece of birch-bark.&nbsp; He knew the bark was there, and,
though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its
crisp rustling as he fumbled for it.&nbsp; Try as he would, he
could not clutch hold of it.&nbsp; And all the time, in his
consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were
freezing.&nbsp; This thought tended to put him in a panic, but he
fought against it and kept calm.&nbsp; He pulled on his mittens
with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his
hands with all his might against his sides.&nbsp; He did this
sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog
sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly
over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently
as it watched the man.&nbsp; And the man as he beat and threshed
with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he
regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural
covering.</p>
<p>After a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of
sensation in his beaten fingers.&nbsp; The faint tingling grew
stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was
excruciating, but which the man hailed with satisfaction.&nbsp;
He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the
birch-bark.&nbsp; The exposed fingers were quickly going numb
again.&nbsp; Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur
matches.&nbsp; But the tremendous cold had already driven the
life out of his fingers.&nbsp; In his effort to separate one
match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow.&nbsp; He
tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed.&nbsp; The dead
fingers could neither touch nor clutch.&nbsp; He was very
careful.&nbsp; He drove the thought of his freezing feet; and
nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the
matches.&nbsp; He watched, using the sense of vision in place of
that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the
bunch, he closed them&mdash;that is, he willed to close them, for
the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey.&nbsp; He
pulled the mitten on the right hand, and beat it fiercely against
his knee.&nbsp; Then, with both mittened hands, he scooped the
bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap.&nbsp; Yet
he was no better off.</p>
<p>After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between
the heels of his mittened hands.&nbsp; In this fashion he carried
it to his mouth.&nbsp; The ice crackled and snapped when by a
violent effort he opened his mouth.&nbsp; He drew the lower jaw
in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch
with his upper teeth in order to separate a match.&nbsp; He
succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap.&nbsp; He
was no better off.&nbsp; He could not pick it up.&nbsp; Then he
devised a way.&nbsp; He picked it up in his teeth and scratched
it on his leg.&nbsp; Twenty times he scratched before he
succeeded in lighting it.&nbsp; As it flamed he held it with his
teeth to the birch-bark.&nbsp; But the burning brimstone went up
his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough
spasmodically.&nbsp; The match fell into the snow and went
out.</p>
<p>The old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right, he thought in the
moment of controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a
man should travel with a partner.&nbsp; He beat his hands, but
failed in exciting any sensation.&nbsp; Suddenly he bared both
hands, removing the mittens with his teeth.&nbsp; He caught the
whole bunch between the heels of his hands.&nbsp; His arm-muscles
not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly
against the matches.&nbsp; Then he scratched the bunch along his
leg.&nbsp; It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at
once!&nbsp; There was no wind to blow them out.&nbsp; He kept his
head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and held the
blazing bunch to the birch-bark.&nbsp; As he so held it, he
became aware of sensation in his hand.&nbsp; His flesh was
burning.&nbsp; He could smell it.&nbsp; Deep down below the
surface he could feel it.&nbsp; The sensation developed into pain
that grew acute.&nbsp; And still he endured it, holding the flame
of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily
because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of
the flame.</p>
<p>At last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands
apart.&nbsp; The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but
the birch-bark was alight.&nbsp; He began laying dry grasses and
the tiniest twigs on the flame.&nbsp; He could not pick and
choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his
hands.&nbsp; Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to
the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his
teeth.&nbsp; He cherished the flame carefully and
awkwardly.&nbsp; It meant life, and it must not perish.&nbsp; The
withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him
begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward.&nbsp; A large piece of
green moss fell squarely on the little fire.&nbsp; He tried to
poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him
poke too far, and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire,
the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and
scattering.&nbsp; He tried to poke them together again, but in
spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with
him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered.&nbsp; Each twig
gushed a puff of smoke and went out.&nbsp; The fire-provider had
failed.&nbsp; As he looked apathetically about him, his eyes
chanced on the dog, sitting across the ruins of the fire from
him, in the snow, making restless, hunching movements, slightly
lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its weight back
and forth on them with wistful eagerness.</p>
<p>The sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head.&nbsp; He
remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed
a steer and crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved.&nbsp;
He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until
the numbness went out of them.&nbsp; Then he could build another
fire.&nbsp; He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his
voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who
had never known the man to speak in such way before.&nbsp;
Something was the matter, and its suspicious nature sensed
danger,&mdash;it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in
its brain arose an apprehension of the man.&nbsp; It flattened
its ears down at the sound of the man&rsquo;s voice, and its
restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of
its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the
man.&nbsp; He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the
dog.&nbsp; This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and the
animal sidled mincingly away.</p>
<p>The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for
calmness.&nbsp; Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of his
teeth, and got upon his feet.&nbsp; He glanced down at first in
order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the
absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the
earth.&nbsp; His erect position in itself started to drive the
webs of suspicion from the dog&rsquo;s mind; and when he spoke
peremptorily, with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog
rendered its customary allegiance and came to him.&nbsp; As it
came within reaching distance, the man lost his control.&nbsp;
His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine
surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that
there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers.&nbsp; He had
forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were
freezing more and more.&nbsp; All this happened quickly, and
before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his
arms.&nbsp; He sat down in the snow, and in this fashion held the
dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.</p>
<p>But it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his
arms and sit there.&nbsp; He realized that he could not kill the
dog.&nbsp; There was no way to do it.&nbsp; With his helpless
hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor
throttle the animal.&nbsp; He released it, and it plunged wildly
away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling.&nbsp; It
halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears
sharply pricked forward.&nbsp; The man looked down at his hands
in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of
his arms.&nbsp; It struck him as curious that one should have to
use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were.&nbsp; He
began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened
hands against his sides.&nbsp; He did this for five minutes,
violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to
put a stop to his shivering.&nbsp; But no sensation was aroused
in the hands.&nbsp; He had an impression that they hung like
weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the
impression down, he could not find it.</p>
<p>A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to
him.&nbsp; This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that
it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes,
or of losing his hands and feet, but that it was a matter of life
and death with the chances against him.&nbsp; This threw him into
a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old,
dim trail.&nbsp; The dog joined in behind and kept up with
him.&nbsp; He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he
had never known in his life.&nbsp; Slowly, as he ploughed and
floundered through the snow, he began to see things
again&mdash;the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the
leafless aspens, and the sky.&nbsp; The running made him feel
better.&nbsp; He did not shiver.&nbsp; Maybe, if he ran on, his
feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would
reach camp and the boys.&nbsp; Without doubt he would lose some
fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take
care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there.&nbsp;
And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that
said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too
many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him,
and that he would soon be stiff and dead.&nbsp; This thought he
kept in the background and refused to consider.&nbsp; Sometimes
it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust
it back and strove to think of other things.</p>
<p>It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so
frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and
took the weight of his body.&nbsp; He seemed to himself to skim
along above the surface and to have no connection with the
earth.&nbsp; Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, and he
wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the
earth.</p>
<p>His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had
one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance.&nbsp; Several times he
stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell.&nbsp;
When he tried to rise, he failed.&nbsp; He must sit and rest, he
decided, and next time he would merely walk and keep on
going.&nbsp; As he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he
was feeling quite warm and comfortable.&nbsp; He was not
shivering, and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his
chest and trunk.&nbsp; And yet, when he touched his nose or
cheeks, there was no sensation.&nbsp; Running would not thaw them
out.&nbsp; Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet.&nbsp; Then
the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must
be extending.&nbsp; He tried to keep this thought down, to forget
it, to think of something else; he was aware of the panicky
feeling that it caused, and he was afraid of the panic.&nbsp; But
the thought asserted itself, and persisted, until it produced a
vision of his body totally frozen.&nbsp; This was too much, and
he made another wild run along the trail.&nbsp; Once he slowed
down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself
made him run again.</p>
<p>And all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels.&nbsp;
When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its
forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and
intent.&nbsp; The warmth and security of the animal angered him,
and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears
appeasingly.&nbsp; This time the shivering came more quickly upon
the man.&nbsp; He was losing in his battle with the frost.&nbsp;
It was creeping into his body from all sides.&nbsp; The thought
of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when
he staggered and pitched headlong.&nbsp; It was his last
panic.&nbsp; When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat
up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death
with dignity.&nbsp; However, the conception did not come to him
in such terms.&nbsp; His idea of it was that he had been making a
fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut
off&mdash;such was the simile that occurred to him.&nbsp; Well,
he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it
decently.&nbsp; With this new-found peace of mind came the first
glimmerings of drowsiness.&nbsp; A good idea, he thought, to
sleep off to death.&nbsp; It was like taking an
an&aelig;sthetic.&nbsp; Freezing was not so bad as people
thought.&nbsp; There were lots worse ways to die.</p>
<p>He pictured the boys finding his body next day.&nbsp; Suddenly
he found himself with them, coming along the trail and looking
for himself.&nbsp; And, still with them, he came around a turn in
the trail and found himself lying in the snow.&nbsp; He did not
belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of
himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself in the
snow.&nbsp; It certainly was cold, was his thought.&nbsp; When he
got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold
was.&nbsp; He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer
on Sulphur Creek.&nbsp; He could see him quite clearly, warm and
comfortable, and smoking a pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, old hoss; you were right,&rdquo; the
man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek.</p>
<p>Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most
comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known.&nbsp; The dog
sat facing him and waiting.&nbsp; The brief day drew to a close
in a long, slow twilight.&nbsp; There were no signs of a fire to
be made, and, besides, never in the dog&rsquo;s experience had it
known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire.&nbsp;
As the twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered
it, and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined
softly, then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being
chidden by the man.&nbsp; But the man remained silent.&nbsp;
Later, the dog whined loudly.&nbsp; And still later it crept
close to the man and caught the scent of death.&nbsp; This made
the animal bristle and back away.&nbsp; A little longer it
delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone
brightly in the cold sky.&nbsp; Then it turned and trotted up the
trail in the direction of the camp it knew, where were the other
food-providers and fire-providers.</p>
<h2>THAT SPOT</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think much of Stephen Mackaye any more, though I
used to swear by him.&nbsp; I know that in those days I loved him
more than my own brother.&nbsp; If ever I meet Stephen Mackaye
again, I shall not be responsible for my actions.&nbsp; It passes
beyond me that a man with whom I shared food and blanket, and
with whom I mushed over the Chilcoot Trail, should turn out the
way he did.&nbsp; I always sized Steve up as a square man, a
kindly comrade, without an iota of anything vindictive or
malicious in his nature.&nbsp; I shall never trust my judgment in
men again.&nbsp; Why, I nursed that man through typhoid fever; we
starved together on the headwaters of the Stewart; and he saved
my life on the Little Salmon.&nbsp; And now, after the years we
were together, all I can say of Stephen Mackaye is that he is the
meanest man I ever knew.</p>
<p>We started for the Klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we
started too late to get over Chilcoot Pass before the
freeze-up.&nbsp; We packed our outfit on our backs part way over,
when the snow began to fly, and then we had to buy dogs in order
to sled it the rest of the way.&nbsp; That was how we came to get
that Spot.&nbsp; Dogs were high, and we paid one hundred and ten
dollars for him.&nbsp; He looked worth it.&nbsp; I say
<i>looked</i>, because he was one of the finest-appearing dogs I
ever saw.&nbsp; He weighed sixty pounds, and he had all the lines
of a good sled animal.&nbsp; We never could make out his
breed.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t husky, nor Malemute, nor Hudson Bay;
he looked like all of them and he didn&rsquo;t look like any of
them; and on top of it all he had some of the white man&rsquo;s
dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of the mixed
yellow-brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing colour,
there was a spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket.&nbsp;
That was why we called him Spot.</p>
<p>He was a good looker all right.&nbsp; When he was in condition
his muscles stood out in bunches all over him.&nbsp; And he was
the strongest-looking brute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most
intelligent-looking.&nbsp; To run your eyes over him, you&rsquo;d
think he could outpull three dogs of his own weight.&nbsp; Maybe
he could, but I never saw it.&nbsp; His intelligence didn&rsquo;t
run that way.&nbsp; He could steal and forage to perfection; he
had an instinct that was positively gruesome for divining when
work was to be done and for making a sneak accordingly; and for
getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of
inspired.&nbsp; But when it came to work, the way that
intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of
wobbling, stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.</p>
<p>There are times when I think it wasn&rsquo;t stupidity.&nbsp;
Maybe, like some men I know, he was too wise to work.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he put it all over us with that
intelligence of his.&nbsp; Maybe he figured it all out and
decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot
better than work all the time and no licking.&nbsp; He was
intelligent enough for such a computation.&nbsp; I tell you,
I&rsquo;ve sat and looked into that dog&rsquo;s eyes till the
shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like
yeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining out.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t express myself about that intelligence.&nbsp; It is
beyond mere words.&nbsp; I saw it, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; At
times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into his
eyes; and what I saw there frightened me and started all sorts of
ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest.&nbsp; I
tell you I sensed something big in that brute&rsquo;s eyes; there
was a message there, but I wasn&rsquo;t big enough myself to
catch it.&nbsp; Whatever it was (I know I&rsquo;m making a fool
of myself)&mdash;whatever it was, it baffled me.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t give an inkling of what I saw in that brute&rsquo;s
eyes; it wasn&rsquo;t light, it wasn&rsquo;t colour; it was
something that moved, away back, when the eyes themselves
weren&rsquo;t moving.&nbsp; And I guess I didn&rsquo;t see it
move either; I only sensed that it moved.&nbsp; It was an
expression&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it was&mdash;and I got an
impression of it.&nbsp; No; it was different from a mere
expression; it was more than that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
it was, but it gave me a feeling of kinship just the same.&nbsp;
Oh, no, not sentimental kinship.&nbsp; It was, rather, a kinship
of equality.&nbsp; Those eyes never pleaded like a deer&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; They challenged.&nbsp; No, it wasn&rsquo;t
defiance.&nbsp; It was just a calm assumption of equality.&nbsp;
And I don&rsquo;t think it was deliberate.&nbsp; My belief is
that it was unconscious on his part.&nbsp; It was there because
it was there, and it couldn&rsquo;t help shining out.&nbsp; No, I
don&rsquo;t mean shine.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t shine; it
<i>moved</i>.&nbsp; I know I&rsquo;m talking rot, but if
you&rsquo;d looked into that animal&rsquo;s eyes the way I have,
you&rsquo;d understand.&nbsp; Steve was affected the same way I
was.&nbsp; Why, I tried to kill that Spot once&mdash;he was no
good for anything; and I fell down on it.&nbsp; I led him out
into the brush, and he came along slow and unwilling.&nbsp; He
knew what was going on.&nbsp; I stopped in a likely place, put my
foot on the rope, and pulled my big Colt&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And that
dog sat down and looked at me.&nbsp; I tell you he didn&rsquo;t
plead.&nbsp; He just looked.&nbsp; And I saw all kinds of
incomprehensible things moving, yes, <i>moving</i>, in those eyes
of his.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t really see them move; I thought I
saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed
them.&nbsp; And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond
me.&nbsp; It was like killing a man, a conscious, brave man, who
looked calmly into your gun as much as to say, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, too, the message seemed so near that, instead of pulling
the trigger quick, I stopped to see if I could catch the
message.&nbsp; There it was, right before me, glimmering all
around in those eyes of his.&nbsp; And then it was too
late.&nbsp; I got scared.&nbsp; I was trembly all over, and my
stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me
seasick.&nbsp; I just sat down and looked at the dog, and he
looked at me, till I thought I was going crazy.&nbsp; Do you want
to know what I did?&nbsp; I threw down the gun and ran back to
camp with the fear of God in my heart.&nbsp; Steve laughed at
me.&nbsp; But I notice that Steve led Spot into the woods, a week
later, for the same purpose, and that Steve came back alone, and
a little later Spot drifted back, too.</p>
<p>At any rate, Spot wouldn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; We paid a hundred
and ten dollars for him from the bottom of our sack, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t even tighten the
traces.&nbsp; Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in
harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all.&nbsp; Not an
ounce on the traces.&nbsp; He just stood still and wobbled, like
so much jelly.&nbsp; Steve touched him with the whip.&nbsp; He
yelped, but not an ounce.&nbsp; Steve touched him again, a bit
harder, and he howled&mdash;the regular long wolf howl.&nbsp;
Then Steve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the
run from the tent.</p>
<p>I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some
words&mdash;the first we&rsquo;d ever had.&nbsp; He threw the
whip down in the snow and walked away mad.&nbsp; I picked it up
and went to it.&nbsp; That Spot trembled and wobbled and cowered
before ever I swung the lash, and with the first bite of it he
howled like a lost soul.&nbsp; Next he lay down in the
snow.&nbsp; I started the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him
along while I threw the whip into him.&nbsp; He rolled over on
his back and bumped along, his four legs waving in the air,
himself howling as though he was going through a sausage
machine.&nbsp; Steve came back and laughed at me, and I
apologized for what I&rsquo;d said.</p>
<p>There was no getting any work out of that Spot; and to make up
for it, he was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog I ever saw.&nbsp;
On top of that, he was the cleverest thief.&nbsp; There was no
circumventing him.&nbsp; Many a breakfast we went without our
bacon because Spot had been there first.&nbsp; And it was because
of him that we nearly starved to death up the Stewart.&nbsp; He
figured out the way to break into our meat-cache, and what he
didn&rsquo;t eat, the rest of the team did.&nbsp; But he was
impartial.&nbsp; He stole from everybody.&nbsp; He was a restless
dog, always very busy snooping around or going somewhere.&nbsp;
And there was never a camp within five miles that he didn&rsquo;t
raid.&nbsp; The worst of it was that they always came back on us
to pay his board bill, which was just, being the law of the land;
but it was mighty hard on us, especially that first winter on the
Chilcoot, when we were busted, paying for whole hams and sides of
bacon that we never ate.&nbsp; He could fight, too, that
Spot.&nbsp; He could do everything but work.&nbsp; He never
pulled a pound, but he was the boss of the whole team.&nbsp; The
way he made those dogs stand around was an education.&nbsp; He
bullied them, and there was always one or more of them
fresh-marked with his fangs.&nbsp; But he was more than a
bully.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anything that walked on
four legs; and I&rsquo;ve seen him march, single-handed into a
strange team, without any provocation whatever, and put the
<i>kibosh</i> on the whole outfit.&nbsp; Did I say he could
eat?&nbsp; I caught him eating the whip once.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
straight.&nbsp; He started in at the lash, and when I caught him
he was down to the handle, and still going.</p>
<p>But he was a good looker.&nbsp; At the end of the first week
we sold him for seventy-five dollars to the Mounted Police.&nbsp;
They had experienced dog-drivers, and we knew that by the time
he&rsquo;d covered the six hundred miles to Dawson he&rsquo;d be
a good sled-dog.&nbsp; I say we <i>knew</i>, for we were just
getting acquainted with that Spot.&nbsp; A little later we were
not brash enough to know anything where he was concerned.&nbsp; A
week later we woke up in the morning to the dangdest dog-fight
we&rsquo;d ever heard.&nbsp; It was that Spot come back and
knocking the team into shape.&nbsp; We ate a pretty depressing
breakfast, I can tell you; but cheered up two hours afterward
when we sold him to an official courier, bound in to Dawson with
government despatches.&nbsp; That Spot was only three days in
coming back, and, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a rough
house.</p>
<p>We spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was
across the pass, freighting other people&rsquo;s outfits; and we
made a fat stake.&nbsp; Also, we made money out of Spot.&nbsp; If
we sold him once, we sold him twenty times.&nbsp; He always came
back, and no one asked for their money.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t
want the money.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d have paid handsomely for any one
to take him off our hands for keeps&rsquo;.&nbsp; We had to get
rid of him, and we couldn&rsquo;t give him away, for that would
have been suspicious.&nbsp; But he was such a fine looker that we
never had any difficulty in selling him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Unbroke,&rdquo; we&rsquo;d say, and they&rsquo;d pay any
old price for him.&nbsp; We sold him as low as twenty-five
dollars, and once we got a hundred and fifty for him.&nbsp; That
particular party returned him in person, refused to take his
money back, and the way he abused us was something awful.&nbsp;
He said it was cheap at the price to tell us what he thought of
us; and we felt he was so justified that we never talked
back.&nbsp; But to this day I&rsquo;ve never quite regained all
the old self-respect that was mine before that man talked to
me.</p>
<p>When the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our
outfit in a Lake Bennett boat and started for Dawson.&nbsp; We
had a good team of dogs, and of course we piled them on top the
outfit.&nbsp; That Spot was along&mdash;there was no losing him;
and a dozen times, the first day, he knocked one or another of
the dogs overboard in the course of fighting with them.&nbsp; It
was close quarters, and he didn&rsquo;t like being crowded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What that dog needs is space,&rdquo; Steve said the
second day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s maroon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did, running the boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to
jump ashore.&nbsp; Two of the other dogs, good dogs, followed
him; and we lost two whole days trying to find them.&nbsp; We
never saw those two dogs again; but the quietness and relief we
enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused his hundred and
fifty, that it was cheap at the price.&nbsp; For the first time
in months Steve and I laughed and whistled and sang.&nbsp; We
were as happy as clams.&nbsp; The dark days were over.&nbsp; The
nightmare had been lifted.&nbsp; That Spot was gone.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were standing on
the river-bank at Dawson.&nbsp; A small boat was just arriving
from Lake Bennett.&nbsp; I saw Steve give a start, and heard him
say something that was not nice and that was not under his
breath.&nbsp; Then I looked; and there, in the bow of the boat,
with ears pricked up, sat Spot.&nbsp; Steve and I sneaked
immediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from
justice.&nbsp; It was this last that the lieutenant of police
thought when he saw us sneaking.&nbsp; He surmised that there
were law-officers in the boat who were after us.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t wait to find out, but kept us in sight, and in the
M. &amp; M. saloon got us in a corner.&nbsp; We had a merry time
explaining, for we refused to go back to the boat and meet Spot;
and finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he
went to the boat.&nbsp; After we got clear of him, we started for
the cabin, and when we arrived, there was that Spot sitting on
the stoop waiting for us.&nbsp; Now how did he know we lived
there?&nbsp; There were forty thousand people in Dawson that
summer, and how did he <i>savve</i> our cabin out of all the
cabins?&nbsp; How did he know we were in Dawson, anyway?&nbsp; I
leave it to you.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t forget what I said about
his intelligence and that immortal something I have seen
glimmering in his eyes.</p>
<p>There was no getting rid of him any more.&nbsp; There were too
many people in Dawson who had bought him up on Chilcoot, and the
story got around.&nbsp; Half a dozen times we put him on board
steamboats going down the Yukon; but he merely went ashore at the
first landing and trotted back up the bank.&nbsp; We
couldn&rsquo;t sell him, we couldn&rsquo;t kill him (both Steve
and I had tried), and nobody else was able to kill him.&nbsp; He
bore a charmed life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen him go down in a
dogfight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of him, and
when they were separated, he&rsquo;d appear on all his four legs,
unharmed, while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would
be lying dead.</p>
<p>I saw him steal a chunk of moose-meat from Major
Dinwiddie&rsquo;s cache so heavy that he could just keep one jump
ahead of Mrs. Dinwiddie&rsquo;s squaw cook, who was after him
with an axe.&nbsp; As he went up the hill, after the squaw gave
up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his Winchester
into the landscape.&nbsp; He emptied his magazine twice, and
never touched that Spot.&nbsp; Then a policeman came along and
arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city
limits.&nbsp; Major Dinwiddie paid his fine, and Steve and I paid
him for the moose-meat at the rate of a dollar a pound, bones and
all.&nbsp; That was what he paid for it.&nbsp; Meat was high that
year.</p>
<p>I am only telling what I saw with my own eyes.&nbsp; And now
I&rsquo;ll tell you something also.&nbsp; I saw that Spot fall
through a water-hole.&nbsp; The ice was three and a half feet
thick, and the current sucked him under like a straw.&nbsp; Three
hundred yards below was the big water-hole used by the
hospital.&nbsp; Spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole,
licked off the water, bit out the ice that had formed between his
toes, trotted up the bank, and whipped a big Newfoundland
belonging to the Gold Commissioner.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the
last water, bound for Stewart River.&nbsp; We took the dogs
along, all except Spot.&nbsp; We figured we&rsquo;d been feeding
him long enough.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d cost us more time and trouble
and money and grub than we&rsquo;d got by selling him on the
Chilcoot&mdash;especially grub.&nbsp; So Steve and I tied him
down in the cabin and pulled our freight.&nbsp; We camped that
night at the mouth of Indian River, and Steve and I were pretty
facetious over having shaken him.&nbsp; Steve was a funny cuss,
and I was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing when a
tornado hit camp.&nbsp; The way that Spot walked into those dogs
and gave them what-for was hair-raising.&nbsp; Now how did he get
loose?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s up to you.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t any
theory.&nbsp; And how did he get across the Klondike River?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s another facer.&nbsp; And anyway, how did he know we
had gone up the Yukon?&nbsp; You see, we went by water, and he
couldn&rsquo;t smell our tracks.&nbsp; Steve and I began to get
superstitious about that dog.&nbsp; He got on our nerves, too;
and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.</p>
<p>The freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of Henderson
Creek, and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit
that was bound up White River after copper.&nbsp; Now that whole
outfit was lost.&nbsp; Never trace nor hide nor hair of men,
dogs, sleds, or anything was ever found.&nbsp; They dropped clean
out of sight.&nbsp; It became one of the mysteries of the
country.&nbsp; Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart, and six
weeks afterward that Spot crawled into camp.&nbsp; He was a
perambulating skeleton, and could just drag along; but he got
there.&nbsp; And what I want to know is, who told him we were up
the Stewart?&nbsp; We could have gone to a thousand other
places.&nbsp; How did he know?&nbsp; You tell me, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you.</p>
<p>No losing him.&nbsp; At the Mayo he started a row with an
Indian dog.&nbsp; The buck who owned the dog took a swing at Spot
with an axe, missed him, and killed his own dog.&nbsp; Talk about
magic and turning bullets aside&mdash;I, for one, consider it a
blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big buck at the
other end of it.&nbsp; And I saw him do it with my own
eyes.&nbsp; That buck didn&rsquo;t want to kill his own
dog.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to show me.</p>
<p>I told you about Spot breaking into our meat cache.&nbsp; It
was nearly the death of us.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any more
meat to be killed, and meat was all we had to live on.&nbsp; The
moose had gone back several hundred miles and the Indians with
them.&nbsp; There we were.&nbsp; Spring was on, and we had to
wait for the river to break.&nbsp; We got pretty thin before we
decided to eat the dogs, and we decided to eat Spot first.&nbsp;
Do you know what that dog did?&nbsp; He sneaked.&nbsp; Now how
did he know our minds were made up to eat him?&nbsp; We sat up
nights laying for him, but he never came back, and we ate the
other dogs.&nbsp; We ate the whole team.</p>
<p>And now for the sequel.&nbsp; You know what it is when a big
river breaks up and a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and
milling and grinding.&nbsp; Just in the thick of it, when the
Stewart went out, rumbling and roaring, we sighted Spot out in
the middle.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d got caught as he was trying to cross
up above somewhere.&nbsp; Steve and I yelled and shouted and ran
up and down the bank, tossing our hats in the air.&nbsp;
Sometimes we&rsquo;d stop and hug each other, we were that
boisterous, for we saw Spot&rsquo;s finish.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
have a chance in a million.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t have any chance
at all.&nbsp; After the ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled
down to the Yukon, and down the Yukon to Dawson, stopping to feed
up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of Henderson
Creek.&nbsp; And as we came in to the bank at Dawson, there sat
that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked up, his tail wagging,
his mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to us.&nbsp; Now
how did he get out of that ice?&nbsp; How did he know we were
coming to Dawson, to the very hour and minute, to be out there on
the bank waiting for us?</p>
<p>The more I think of that Spot, the more I am convinced that
there are things in this world that go beyond science.&nbsp; On
no scientific grounds can that Spot be explained.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s psychic phenomena, or mysticism, or something of that
sort, I guess, with a lot of Theosophy thrown in.&nbsp; The
Klondike is a good country.&nbsp; I might have been there yet,
and become a millionaire, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Spot.&nbsp;
He got on my nerves.&nbsp; I stood him for two years altogether,
and then I guess my stamina broke.&nbsp; It was the summer of
1899 when I pulled out.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t say anything to
Steve.&nbsp; I just sneaked.&nbsp; But I fixed it up all
right.&nbsp; I wrote Steve a note, and enclosed a package of
&ldquo;rough-on-rats,&rdquo; telling him what to do with
it.&nbsp; I was worn down to skin and bone by that Spot, and I
was that nervous that I&rsquo;d jump and look around when there
wasn&rsquo;t anybody within hailing distance.&nbsp; But it was
astonishing the way I recuperated when I got quit of him.&nbsp; I
got back twenty pounds before I arrived in San Francisco, and by
the time I&rsquo;d crossed the ferry to Oakland I was my old self
again, so that even my wife looked in vain for any change in
me.</p>
<p>Steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated.&nbsp;
He took it kind of hard because I&rsquo;d left him with
Spot.&nbsp; Also, he said he&rsquo;d used the
&ldquo;rough-on-rats,&rdquo; per directions, and that there was
nothing doing.&nbsp; A year went by.&nbsp; I was back in the
office and prospering in all ways&mdash;even getting a bit
fat.&nbsp; And then Steve arrived.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t look me
up.&nbsp; I read his name in the steamer list, and wondered
why.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t wonder long.&nbsp; I got up one
morning and found that Spot chained to the gate-post and holding
up the milkman.&nbsp; Steve went north to Seattle, I learned,
that very morning.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t put on any more
weight.&nbsp; My wife made me buy him a collar and tag, and
within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet Persian
cat.&nbsp; There is no getting rid of that Spot.&nbsp; He will be
with me until I die, for he&rsquo;ll never die.&nbsp; My appetite
is not so good since he arrived, and my wife says I am looking
peaked.&nbsp; Last night that Spot got into Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s
hen-house (Harvey is my next-door neighbour) and killed nineteen
of his fancy-bred chickens.&nbsp; I shall have to pay for
them.&nbsp; My neighbours on the other side quarrelled with my
wife and then moved out.&nbsp; Spot was the cause of it.&nbsp;
And that is why I am disappointed in Stephen Mackaye.&nbsp; I had
no idea he was so mean a man.</p>
<h2>FLUSH OF GOLD</h2>
<p>Lon McFane was a bit grumpy, what of losing his tobacco pouch,
or else he might have told me, before we got to it, something
about the cabin at Surprise Lake.&nbsp; All day, turn and turn
about, we had spelled each other at going to the fore and
breaking trail for the dogs.&nbsp; It was heavy snowshoe work,
and did not tend to make a man voluble, yet Lon McFane might have
found breath enough at noon, when we stopped to boil coffee, with
which to tell me.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Surprise
Lake?&mdash;it was Surprise Cabin to me.&nbsp; I had never heard of it
before.&nbsp; I confess I was a bit tired.&nbsp; I had been
looking for Lon to stop and make camp any time for an hour; but I
had too much pride to suggest making camp or to ask him his
intentions; and yet he was my man, lured at a handsome wage to
mush my dogs for me and to obey my commands.&nbsp; I guess I was
a bit grumpy myself.&nbsp; He said nothing, and I was resolved to
ask nothing, even if we tramped on all night.</p>
<p>We came upon the cabin abruptly.&nbsp; For a week of trail we
had met no one, and, in my mind, there had been little likelihood
of meeting any one for a week to come.&nbsp; And yet there it
was, right before my eyes, a cabin, with a dim light in the
window and smoke curling up from the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me&mdash;&rdquo; I began, but
was interrupted by Lon, who muttered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprise Lake&mdash;it lies up a small feeder half a
mile on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the cabin&mdash;who lives in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; was the answer, and the next moment Lon
had rapped on the door, and a woman&rsquo;s voice bade him
enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Dave recently?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Lon answered carelessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the other direction, down Circle City
way.&nbsp; Dave&rsquo;s up Dawson way, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded, and Lon fell to unharnessing the dogs, while
I unlashed the sled and carried the camp outfit into the
cabin.&nbsp; The cabin was a large, one-room affair, and the
woman was evidently alone in it.&nbsp; She pointed to the stove,
where water was already boiling, and Lon set about the
preparation of supper, while I opened the fish-bag and fed the
dogs.&nbsp; I looked for Lon to introduce us, and was vexed that
he did not, for they were evidently old friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Lon McFane, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I heard
her ask him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I remember you now.&nbsp; The last
time I saw you it was on a steamboat, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I
remember . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Her speech seemed suddenly to be frozen by the spectacle of
dread which, I knew, from the tenor I saw mounting in her eyes,
must be on her inner vision.&nbsp; To my astonishment, Lon was
affected by her words and manner.&nbsp; His face showed
desperate, for all his voice sounded hearty and genial, as he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time we met was at Dawson, Queen&rsquo;s
Jubilee, or Birthday, or something&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
remember?&mdash;the canoe races in the river, and the obstacle
races down the main street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terror faded out of her eyes and her whole body
relaxed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes, I do remember,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you won one of the canoe races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Dave been makin&rsquo; it lately?&nbsp;
Strikin&rsquo; it as rich as ever, I suppose?&rdquo; Lon asked,
with apparent irrelevance.</p>
<p>She smiled and nodded, and then, noticing that I had unlashed
the bed roll, she indicated the end of the cabin where I might
spread it.&nbsp; Her own bunk, I noticed, was made up at the
opposite end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was Dave coming when I heard your
dogs,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>After that she said nothing, contenting herself with watching
Lon&rsquo;s cooking operations, and listening the while as for
the sound of dogs along the trail.&nbsp; I lay back on the
blankets and smoked and watched.&nbsp; Here was mystery; I could
make that much out, but no more could I make out.&nbsp; Why in
the deuce hadn&rsquo;t Lon given me the tip before we
arrived?&nbsp; I looked at her face, unnoticed by her, and the
longer I looked the harder it was to take my eyes away.&nbsp; It
was a wonderfully beautiful face, unearthly, I may say, with a
light in it or an expression or something &ldquo;that was never
on land or sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fear and terror had completely
vanished, and it was a placidly beautiful face&mdash;if by
&ldquo;placid&rdquo; one can characterize that intangible and
occult something that I cannot say was a radiance or a light any
more than I can say it was an expression.</p>
<p>Abruptly, as if for the first time, she became aware of my
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Dave recently?&rdquo; she asked me.&nbsp;
It was on the tip of my tongue to say &ldquo;Dave who?&rdquo;
when Lon coughed in the smoke that arose from the sizzling
bacon.&nbsp; The bacon might have caused that cough, but I took
it as a hint and left my question unasked.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I
haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m new in
this part of the country&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; she
interrupted, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve never heard of
Dave&mdash;of Big Dave Walsh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I apologised, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m new in
the country.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve put in most of my time in the Lower
Country, down Nome way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him about Dave,&rdquo; she said to Lon.</p>
<p>Lon seemed put out, but he began in that hearty, genial manner
that I had noticed before.&nbsp; It seemed a shade too hearty and
genial, and it irritated me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave is a fine man,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man, every inch of him, and he stands six
feet four in his socks.&nbsp; His word is as good as his
bond.&nbsp; The man lies who ever says Dave told a lie, and that
man will have to fight with me, too, as well&mdash;if
there&rsquo;s anything left of him when Dave gets done with
him.&nbsp; For Dave is a fighter.&nbsp; Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s a
scrapper from way back.&nbsp; He got a grizzly with a &rsquo;38
popgun.&nbsp; He got clawed some, but he knew what he was
doin&rsquo;.&nbsp; He went into the cave on purpose to get that
grizzly.&nbsp; &rsquo;Fraid of nothing.&nbsp; Free an&rsquo; easy
with his money, or his last shirt an&rsquo; match when out of
money.&nbsp; Why, he drained Surprise Lake here in three weeks
an&rsquo; took out ninety thousand, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;&nbsp;
She flushed and nodded her head proudly.&nbsp; Through his
recital she had followed every word with keenest interest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I must say,&rdquo; Lon went on, &ldquo;that I
was disappointed sore on not meeting Dave here
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lon served supper at one end of the table of whip-sawed
spruce, and we fell to eating.&nbsp; A howling of the dogs took
the woman to the door.&nbsp; She opened it an inch and
listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Dave Walsh?&rdquo; I asked, in an
undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; Lon answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;In hell,
maybe.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you just said that you expected to meet him here
to-night,&rdquo; I challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; was Lon&rsquo;s
reply, in the same cautious undertone.</p>
<p>The woman had closed the door and was returning, and I sat and
meditated upon the fact that this man who told me to shut up
received from me a salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a
month and his board.</p>
<p>Lon washed the dishes, while I smoked and watched the
woman.&nbsp; She seemed more beautiful than ever&mdash;strangely
and weirdly beautiful, it is true.&nbsp; After looking at her
steadfastly for five minutes, I was compelled to come back to the
real world and to glance at Lon McFane.&nbsp; This enabled me to
know, without discussion, that the woman, too, was real.&nbsp; At
first I had taken her for the wife of Dave Walsh; but if Dave
Walsh were dead, as Lon had said, then she could be only his
widow.</p>
<p>It was early to bed, for we faced a long day on the morrow;
and as Lon crawled in beside me under the blankets, I ventured a
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman&rsquo;s crazy, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy as a loon,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>And before I could formulate my next question, Lon McFane, I
swear, was off to sleep.&nbsp; He always went to sleep that
way&mdash;just crawled into the blankets, closed his eyes, and
was off, a demure little heavy breathing rising on the air.&nbsp;
Lon never snored.</p>
<p>And in the morning it was quick breakfast, feed the dogs, load
the sled, and hit the trail.&nbsp; We said good-bye as we pulled
out, and the woman stood in the doorway and watched us off.&nbsp;
I carried the vision of her unearthly beauty away with me, just
under my eyelids, and all I had to do, any time, was to close
them and see her again.&nbsp; The way was unbroken, Surprise Lake
being far off the travelled trails, and Lon and I took turn about
at beating down the feathery snow with our big, webbed shoes so
that the dogs could travel.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you said you
expected to meet Dave Walsh at the cabin,&rdquo; trembled on the
tip of my tongue a score of times.&nbsp; I did not utter
it.&nbsp; I could wait until we knocked off in the middle of the
day.&nbsp; And when the middle of the day came, we went right on,
for, as Lon explained, there was a camp of moose hunters at the
forks of the Teelee, and we could make there by dark.&nbsp; But
we didn&rsquo;t make there by dark, for Bright, the lead-dog,
broke his shoulder-blade, and we lost an hour over him before we
shot him.&nbsp; Then, crossing a timber jam on the frozen bed of
the Teelee, the sled suffered a wrenching capsize, and it was a
case of make camp and repair the runner.&nbsp; I cooked supper
and fed the dogs while Lon made the repairs, and together we got
in the night&rsquo;s supply of ice and firewood.&nbsp; Then we
sat on our blankets, our moccasins steaming on upended sticks
before the fire, and had our evening smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know her?&rdquo; Lon queried
suddenly.&nbsp; I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You noticed the colour of her hair and eyes and her
complexion, well, that&rsquo;s where she got her name&mdash;she
was like the first warm glow of a golden sunrise.&nbsp; She was
called Flush of Gold.&nbsp; Ever heard of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere I had a confused and misty remembrance of having
heard the name, yet it meant nothing to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Flush of
Gold,&rdquo; I repeated; &ldquo;sounds like the name of a
dance-house girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lon shook his head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, she was a good woman, at least in that sense, though
she sinned greatly just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you speak always of her in the past tense,
as though she were dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the darkness on her soul that is the same as
the darkness of death.&nbsp; The Flush of Gold that I knew, that
Dawson knew, and that Forty Mile knew before that, is dead.&nbsp;
That dumb, lunatic creature we saw last night was not Flush of
Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dave?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He built that cabin,&rdquo; Lon answered, &ldquo;He
built it for her . . . and for himself.&nbsp; He is dead.&nbsp;
She is waiting for him there.&nbsp; She half believes he is not
dead.&nbsp; But who can know the whim of a crazed mind?&nbsp;
Maybe she wholly believes he is not dead.&nbsp; At any rate, she
waits for him there in the cabin he built.&nbsp; Who would rouse
the dead?&nbsp; Then who would rouse the living that are
dead?&nbsp; Not I, and that is why I let on to expect to meet
Dave Walsh there last night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bet a stack that
I&rsquo;d a been more surprised than she if I <i>had</i> met him
there last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin
at the beginning, as a white man should, and tell me the whole
tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lon began.&nbsp; &ldquo;Victor Chauvet was an old
Frenchman&mdash;born in the south of France.&nbsp; He came to
California in the days of gold.&nbsp; He was a pioneer.&nbsp; He
found no gold, but, instead, became a maker of bottled
sunshine&mdash;in short, a grape-grower and wine-maker.&nbsp;
Also, he followed gold excitements.&nbsp; That is what brought
him to Alaska in the early days, and over the Chilcoot and down
the Yukon long before the Carmack strike.&nbsp; The old town site
of Ten Mile was Chauvet&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He carried the first mail
into Arctic City.&nbsp; He staked those coal-mines on the
Porcupine a dozen years ago.&nbsp; He grubstaked Loftus into the
Nippennuck Country.&nbsp; Now it happened that Victor Chauvet was
a good Catholic, loving two things in this world, wine and
woman.&nbsp; Wine of all kinds he loved, but of woman, only one,
and she was the mother of Marie Chauvet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I groaned aloud, having meditated beyond self-control
over the fact that I paid this man two hundred and fifty dollars
a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; I complained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you
were telling the story of Flush of Gold.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
a biography of your old French wine-bibber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lon calmly lighted his pipe, took one good puff, then put the
pipe aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you asked me to begin at the
beginning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the beginning of Flush of Gold is the old French
wine-bibber, for he was the father of Marie Chauvet, and Marie
Chauvet was the Flush of Gold.&nbsp; What more do you want?&nbsp;
Victor Chauvet never had much luck to speak of.&nbsp; He managed
to live, and to get along, and to take good care of Marie, who
resembled the one woman he had loved.&nbsp; He took very good
care of her.&nbsp; Flush of Gold was the pet name he gave
her.&nbsp; Flush of Gold Creek was named after her&mdash;Flush of
Gold town site, too.&nbsp; The old man was great on town sites,
only he never landed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, honestly,&rdquo; Lon said, with one of his
lightning changes, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen her, what do you
think of her&mdash;of her looks, I mean?&nbsp; How does she
strike your beauty sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is remarkably beautiful,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never saw anything like her in my life.&nbsp; In spite
of the fact, last night, that I guessed she was mad, I could not
keep my eyes off of her.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t curiosity.&nbsp;
It was wonder, sheer wonder, she was so strangely
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was more strangely beautiful before the darkness
fell upon her,&rdquo; Lon said softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was truly
the Flush of Gold.&nbsp; She turned all men&rsquo;s hearts . . .
and heads.&nbsp; She recalls, with an effort, that I once won a
canoe race at Dawson&mdash;I, who once loved her, and was told by
her of her love for me.&nbsp; It was her beauty that made all men
love her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; got the apple from
Paris, on application, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any
Trojan War, and to top it off she&rsquo;d have thrown Paris
down.&nbsp; And now she lives in darkness, and she who was always
fickle, for the first time is constant&mdash;and constant to a
shade, to a dead man she does not realize is dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the way it was.&nbsp; You remember what I
said last night of Dave Walsh&mdash;Big Dave Walsh?&nbsp; He was
all that I said, and more, many times more.&nbsp; He came into
this country in the late eighties&mdash;that&rsquo;s a pioneer
for you.&nbsp; He was twenty years old then.&nbsp; He was a young
bull.&nbsp; When he was twenty-five he could lift clear of the
ground thirteen fifty-pound sacks of flour.&nbsp; At first, each
fall of the year, famine drove him out.&nbsp; It was a lone land
in those days.&nbsp; No river steamboats, no grub, nothing but
salmon bellies and rabbit tracks.&nbsp; But after famine chased
him out three years, he said he&rsquo;d had enough of being
chased; and the next year he stayed.&nbsp; He lived on straight
meat when he was lucky enough to get it; he ate eleven dogs that
winter; but he stayed.&nbsp; And the next winter he stayed, and
the next.&nbsp; He never did leave the country again.&nbsp; He
was a bull, a great bull.&nbsp; He could kill the strongest man
in the country with hard work.&nbsp; He could outpack a Chilcat
Indian, he could outpaddle a Stick, and he could travel all day
with wet feet when the thermometer registered fifty below zero,
and that&rsquo;s going some, I tell you, for vitality.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d freeze your feet at twenty-five below if you wet them
and tried to keep on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Walsh was a bull for strength.&nbsp; And yet he
was soft and easy-natured.&nbsp; Anybody could do him, the latest
short-horn in camp could lie his last dollar out of him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t worry me,&rsquo; he had a way of
laughing off his softness; &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t keep me awake
nights.&rsquo; Now don&rsquo;t get the idea that he had no
backbone.&nbsp; You remember about the bear he went after with
the popgun.&nbsp; When it came to fighting Dave was the blamedest
ever.&nbsp; He was the limit, if by that I may describe his
unlimitedness when he got into action, he was easy and kind with
the weak, but the strong had to give trail when he went by.&nbsp;
And he was a man that men liked, which is the finest word of all,
a man&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave never took part in the big stampede to Dawson when
Carmack made the Bonanza strike.&nbsp; You see, Dave was just
then over on Mammon Creek strikin&rsquo; it himself.&nbsp; He
discovered Mammon Creek.&nbsp; Cleaned eighty-four thousand up
that winter, and opened up the claim so that it promised a couple
of hundred thousand for the next winter.&nbsp; Then, summer
bein&rsquo; on and the ground sloshy, he took a trip up the Yukon
to Dawson to see what Carmack&rsquo;s strike looked like.&nbsp;
And there he saw Flush of Gold.&nbsp; I remember the night.&nbsp;
I shall always remember.&nbsp; It was something sudden, and it
makes one shiver to think of a strong man with all the strength
withered out of him by one glance from the soft eyes of a weak,
blond, female creature like Flush of Gold.&nbsp; It was at her
dad&rsquo;s cabin, old Victor Chauvet&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Some friend
had brought Dave along to talk over town sites on Mammon
Creek.&nbsp; But little talking did he do, and what he did was
mostly gibberish.&nbsp; I tell you the sight of Flush of Gold had
sent Dave clean daffy.&nbsp; Old Victor Chauvet insisted after
Dave left that he had been drunk.&nbsp; And so he had.&nbsp; He
was drunk, but Flush of Gold was the strong drink that made him
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settled it, that first glimpse he caught of
her.&nbsp; He did not start back down the Yukon in a week, as he
had intended.&nbsp; He lingered on a month, two months, all
summer.&nbsp; And we who had suffered understood, and wondered
what the outcome would be.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, in our minds, it
seemed that Flush of Gold had met her master.&nbsp; And why
not?&nbsp; There was romance sprinkled all over Dave Walsh.&nbsp;
He was a Mammon King, he had made the Mammon Creek strike; he was
an old sour dough, one of the oldest pioneers in the
land&mdash;men turned to look at him when he went by, and said to
one another in awed undertones, &lsquo;There goes Dave
Walsh.&rsquo;&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; He stood six feet four; he
had yellow hair himself that curled on his neck; and he was a
bull&mdash;a yellow-maned bull just turned thirty-one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Flush of Gold loved him, and, having danced him
through a whole summer&rsquo;s courtship, at the end their
engagement was made known.&nbsp; The fall of the year was at
hand, Dave had to be back for the winter&rsquo;s work on Mammon
Creek, and Flush of Gold refused to be married right away.&nbsp;
Dave put Dusky Burns in charge of the Mammon Creek claim, and
himself lingered on in Dawson.&nbsp; Little use.&nbsp; She wanted
her freedom a while longer; she must have it, and she would not
marry until next year.&nbsp; And so, on the first ice, Dave Walsh
went alone down the Yukon behind his dogs, with the understanding
that the marriage would take place when he arrived on the first
steamboat of the next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Dave was as true as the Pole Star, and she was as
false as a magnetic needle in a cargo of loadstone.&nbsp; Dave
was as steady and solid as she was fickle and fly-away, and in
some way Dave, who never doubted anybody, doubted her.&nbsp; It
was the jealousy of his love, perhaps, and maybe it was the
message ticked off from her soul to his; but at any rate Dave was
worried by fear of her inconstancy.&nbsp; He was afraid to trust
her till the next year, he had so to trust her, and he was pretty
well beside himself.&nbsp; Some of it I got from old Victor
Chauvet afterwards, and from all that I have pieced together I
conclude that there was something of a scene before Dave pulled
north with his dogs.&nbsp; He stood up before the old Frenchman,
with Flush of Gold beside him, and announced that they were
plighted to each other.&nbsp; He was very dramatic, with fire in
his eyes, old Victor said.&nbsp; He talked something about
&lsquo;until death do us part&rsquo;; and old Victor especially
remembered that at one place Dave took her by the shoulder with
his great paw and almost shook her as he said: &lsquo;Even unto
death are you mine, and I would rise from the grave to claim
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Old Victor distinctly remembered those words
&lsquo;Even unto death are you mine, and I would rise from the
grave to claim you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he told me afterwards that
Flush of Gold was pretty badly frightened, and that he afterwards
took Dave to one side privately and told him that that
wasn&rsquo;t the way to hold Flush of Gold&mdash;that he must
humour her and gentle her if he wanted to keep her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no discussion in my mind but that Flush of
Gold was frightened.&nbsp; She was a savage herself in her
treatment of men, while men had always treated her as a soft and
tender and too utterly-utter something that must not be
hurt.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know what harshness was . . . until
Dave Walsh, standing his six feet four, a big bull, gripped her
and pawed her and assured her that she was his until death, and
then some.&nbsp; And besides, in Dawson, that winter, was a
music-player&mdash;one of those macaroni-eating,
greasy-tenor-Eye-talian-dago propositions&mdash;and Flush of Gold
lost her heart to him.&nbsp; Maybe it was only
fascination&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Sometimes it seems to
me that she really did love Dave Walsh.&nbsp; Perhaps it was
because he had frightened her with that even-unto-death,
rise-from-the-grave stunt of his that she in the end inclined to
the dago music-player.&nbsp; But it is all guesswork, and the
facts are, sufficient.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t a dago; he was a
Russian count&mdash;this was straight; and he wasn&rsquo;t a
professional piano-player or anything of the sort.&nbsp; He
played the violin and the piano, and he sang&mdash;sang
well&mdash;but it was for his own pleasure and for the pleasure
of those he sang for.&nbsp; He had money, too&mdash;and right
here let me say that Flush of Gold never cared a rap for
money.&nbsp; She was fickle, but she was never sordid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to be getting along.&nbsp; She was plighted to
Dave, and Dave was coming up on the first steamboat to get
her&mdash;that was the summer of &rsquo;98, and the first
steamboat was to be expected the middle of June.&nbsp; And Flush
of Gold was afraid to throw Dave down and face him
afterwards.&nbsp; It was all planned suddenly.&nbsp; The Russian
music-player, the Count, was her obedient slave.&nbsp; She
planned it, I know.&nbsp; I learned as much from old Victor
afterwards.&nbsp; The Count took his orders from her, and caught
that first steamboat down.&nbsp; It was the <i>Golden
Rocket</i>.&nbsp; And so did Flush of Gold catch it.&nbsp; And so
did I.&nbsp; I was going to Circle City, and I was flabbergasted
when I found Flush of Gold on board.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see her
name down on the passenger list.&nbsp; She was with the Count
fellow all the time, happy and smiling, and I noticed that the
Count fellow was down on the list as having his wife along.&nbsp;
There it was, state-room, number, and all.&nbsp; The first I knew
that he was married, only I didn&rsquo;t see anything of the wife
. . . unless Flush of Gold was so counted.&nbsp; I wondered if
they&rsquo;d got married ashore before starting.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;d been talk about them in Dawson, you see, and bets
had been laid that the Count fellow had cut Dave out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked with the purser.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know
anything more about it than I did; he didn&rsquo;t know Flush of
Gold, anyway, and besides, he was almost rushed to death.&nbsp;
You know what a Yukon steamboat is, but you can&rsquo;t guess
what the <i>Golden Rocket</i> was when it left Dawson that June
of 1898.&nbsp; She was a hummer.&nbsp; Being the first steamer
out, she carried all the scurvy patients and hospital
wrecks.&nbsp; Then she must have carried a couple of millions of
Klondike dust and nuggets, to say nothing of a packed and jammed
passenger list, deck passengers galore, and bucks and squaws and
dogs without end.&nbsp; And she was loaded down to the guards
with freight and baggage.&nbsp; There was a mountain of the same
on the fore-lower-deck, and each little stop along the way added
to it.&nbsp; I saw the box come aboard at Teelee Portage, and I
knew it for what it was, though I little guessed the joker that
was in it.&nbsp; And they piled it on top of everything else on
the fore-lower-deck, and they didn&rsquo;t pile it any too
securely either.&nbsp; The mate expected to come back to it
again, and then forgot about it.&nbsp; I thought at the time that
there was something familiar about the big husky dog that climbed
over the baggage and freight and lay down next to the box.&nbsp;
And then we passed the <i>Glendale</i>, bound up for
Dawson.&nbsp; As she saluted us, I thought of Dave on board of
her and hurrying to Dawson to Flush of Gold.&nbsp; I turned and
looked at her where she stood by the rail.&nbsp; Her eyes were
bright, but she looked a bit frightened by the sight of the other
steamer, and she was leaning closely to the Count fellow as for
protection.&nbsp; She needn&rsquo;t have leaned so safely against
him, and I needn&rsquo;t have been so sure of a disappointed Dave
Walsh arriving at Dawson.&nbsp; For Dave Walsh wasn&rsquo;t on
the <i>Glendale</i>.&nbsp; There were a lot of things I
didn&rsquo;t know, but was soon to know&mdash;for instance, that
the pair were not yet married.&nbsp; Inside half an hour
preparations for the marriage took place.&nbsp; What of the sick
men in the main cabin, and of the crowded condition of the
<i>Golden Rocket</i>, the likeliest place for the ceremony was
found forward, on the lower deck, in an open space next to the
rail and gang-plank and shaded by the mountain of freight with
the big box on top and the sleeping dog beside it.&nbsp; There
was a missionary on board, getting off at Eagle City, which was
the next step, so they had to use him quick.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what they&rsquo;d planned to do, get married on the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve run ahead of the facts.&nbsp; The reason
Dave Walsh wasn&rsquo;t on the <i>Glendale</i> was because he was
on the <i>Golden Rocket</i>.&nbsp; It was this way.&nbsp; After
loiterin&rsquo; in Dawson on account of Flush of Gold, he went
down to Mammon Creek on the ice.&nbsp; And there he found Dusky
Burns doing so well with the claim, there was no need for him to
be around.&nbsp; So he put some grub on the sled, harnessed the
dogs, took an Indian along, and pulled out for Surprise
Lake.&nbsp; He always had a liking for that section.&nbsp; Maybe
you don&rsquo;t know how the creek turned out to be a
four-flusher; but the prospects were good at the time, and Dave
proceeded to build his cabin and hers.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
cabin we slept in.&nbsp; After he finished it, he went off on a
moose hunt to the forks of the Teelee, takin&rsquo; the Indian
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is what happened.&nbsp; Came on a cold
snap.&nbsp; The juice went down forty, fifty, sixty below
zero.&nbsp; I remember that snap&mdash;I was at Forty Mile; and I
remember the very day.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning the spirit thermometer at the N. A. T. &amp; T.
Company&rsquo;s store went down to seventy-five below zero.&nbsp;
And that morning, near the forks of the Teelee, Dave Walsh was
out after moose with that blessed Indian of his.&nbsp; I got it
all from the Indian afterwards&mdash;we made a trip over the ice
together to Dyea.&nbsp; That morning Mr. Indian broke through the
ice and wet himself to the waist.&nbsp; Of course he began to
freeze right away.&nbsp; The proper thing was to build a
fire.&nbsp; But Dave Walsh was a bull.&nbsp; It was only half a
mile to camp, where a fire was already burning.&nbsp; What was
the good of building another?&nbsp; He threw Mr. Indian over his
shoulder&mdash;and ran with him&mdash;half a mile&mdash;with the
thermometer at seventy-five below.&nbsp; You know what that
means.&nbsp; Suicide.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no other name for
it.&nbsp; Why, that buck Indian weighed over two hundred himself,
and Dave ran half a mile with him.&nbsp; Of course he froze his
lungs.&nbsp; Must have frozen them near solid.&nbsp; It was a
tomfool trick for any man to do.&nbsp; And anyway, after
lingering horribly for several weeks, Dave Walsh died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian didn&rsquo;t know what to do with the
corpse.&nbsp; Ordinarily he&rsquo;d have buried him and let it go
at that.&nbsp; But he knew that Dave Walsh was a big man, worth
lots of money, a <i>hi-yu skookum</i> chief.&nbsp; Likewise
he&rsquo;d seen the bodies of other <i>hi-yu skookums</i> carted
around the country like they were worth something.&nbsp; So he
decided to take Dave&rsquo;s body to Forty Mile, which was
Dave&rsquo;s headquarters.&nbsp; You know how the ice is on the
grass roots in this country&mdash;well, the Indian planted Dave
under a foot of soil&mdash;in short, he put Dave on ice.&nbsp;
Dave could have stayed there a thousand years and still been the
same old Dave.&nbsp; You understand&mdash;just the same as a
refrigerator.&nbsp; Then the Indian brings over a whipsaw from
the cabin at Surprise Lake and makes lumber enough for the
box.&nbsp; Also, waiting for the thaw, he goes out and shoots
about ten thousand pounds of moose.&nbsp; This he keeps on ice,
too.&nbsp; Came the thaw.&nbsp; The Teelee broke.&nbsp; He built
a raft and loaded it with the meat, the big box with Dave inside,
and Dave&rsquo;s team of dogs, and away they went down the
Teelee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The raft got caught on a timber jam and hung up two
days.&nbsp; It was scorching hot weather, and Mr. Indian nearly
lost his moose meat.&nbsp; So when he got to Teelee Portage he
figured a steamboat would get to Forty Mile quicker than his
raft.&nbsp; He transferred his cargo, and there you are,
fore-lower deck of the <i>Golden Rocket</i>, Flush of Gold being
married, and Dave Walsh in his big box casting the shade for
her.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s one thing I clean forgot.&nbsp; No
wonder I thought the husky dog that came aboard at Teelee Portage
was familiar.&nbsp; It was Pee-lat, Dave Walsh&rsquo;s lead-dog
and favourite&mdash;a terrible fighter, too.&nbsp; He was lying
down beside the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flush of Gold caught sight of me, called me over, shook
hands with me, and introduced me to the Count.&nbsp; She was
beautiful.&nbsp; I was as mad for her then as ever.&nbsp; She
smiled into my eyes and said I must sign as one of the
witnesses.&nbsp; And there was no refusing her.&nbsp; She was
ever a child, cruel as children are cruel.&nbsp; Also, she told
me she was in possession of the only two bottles of champagne in
Dawson&mdash;or that had been in Dawson the night before; and
before I knew it I was scheduled to drink her and the
Count&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; Everybody crowded round, the captain
of the steamboat, very prominent, trying to ring in on the wine,
I guess.&nbsp; It was a funny wedding.&nbsp; On the upper deck
the hospital wrecks, with various feet in the grave, gathered and
looked down to see.&nbsp; There were Indians all jammed in the
circle, too, big bucks, and their squaws and kids, to say nothing
of about twenty-five snarling wolf-dogs.&nbsp; The missionary
lined the two of them up and started in with the service.&nbsp;
And just then a dog-fight started, high up on the pile of
freight&mdash;Pee-lat lying beside the big box, and a
white-haired brute belonging to one of the Indians.&nbsp; The
fight wasn&rsquo;t explosive at all.&nbsp; The brutes just
snarled at each other from a distance&mdash;tapping at each other
long-distance, you know, saying dast and dassent, dast and
dassent.&nbsp; The noise was rather disturbing, but you could
hear the missionary&rsquo;s voice above it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no particularly easy way of getting at the
two dogs, except from the other side of the pile.&nbsp; But
nobody was on that side&mdash;everybody watching the ceremony,
you see.&nbsp; Even then everything might have been all right if
the captain hadn&rsquo;t thrown a club at the dogs.&nbsp; That
was what precipitated everything.&nbsp; As I say, if the captain
hadn&rsquo;t thrown that club, nothing might have happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missionary had just reached the point where he was
saying &lsquo;In sickness and in health,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Till
death us do part.&rsquo;&nbsp; And just then the captain threw
the club.&nbsp; I saw the whole thing.&nbsp; It landed on
Pee-lat, and at that instant the white brute jumped him.&nbsp;
The club caused it.&nbsp; Their two bodies struck the box, and it
began to slide, its lower end tilting down.&nbsp; It was a long
oblong box, and it slid down slowly until it reached the
perpendicular, when it came down on the run.&nbsp; The onlookers
on that side the circle had time to get out from under.&nbsp;
Flush of Gold and the Count, on the opposite side of the circle,
were facing the box; the missionary had his back to it.&nbsp; The
box must have fallen ten feet straight up and down, and it hit
end on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now mind you, not one of us knew that Dave Walsh was
dead.&nbsp; We thought he was on the <i>Glendale</i>, bound for
Dawson.&nbsp; The missionary had edged off to one side, and so
Flush of Gold faced the box when it struck.&nbsp; It was like in
a play.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t have been better planned.&nbsp;
It struck on end, and on the right end; the whole front of the
box came off; and out swept Dave Walsh on his feet, partly
wrapped in a blanket, his yellow hair flying and showing bright
in the sun.&nbsp; Right out of the box, on his feet, he swept
upon Flush of Gold.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know he was dead, but
it was unmistakable, after hanging up two days on a timber jam,
that he was rising all right from the dead to claim her.&nbsp;
Possibly that is what she thought.&nbsp; At any rate, the sight
froze her.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t move.&nbsp; She just sort of
wilted and watched Dave Walsh coming for her!&nbsp; And he got
her.&nbsp; It looked almost as though he threw his arms around
her, but whether or not this happened, down to the deck they went
together.&nbsp; We had to drag Dave Walsh&rsquo;s body clear
before we could get hold of her.&nbsp; She was in a faint, but it
would have been just as well if she had never come out of that
faint; for when she did, she fell to screaming the way insane
people do.&nbsp; She kept it up for hours, till she was
exhausted.&nbsp; Oh, yes, she recovered.&nbsp; You saw her last
night, and know how much recovered she is.&nbsp; She is not
violent, it is true, but she lives in darkness.&nbsp; She
believes that she is waiting for Dave Walsh, and so she waits in
the cabin he built for her.&nbsp; She is no longer fickle.&nbsp;
It is nine years now that she has been faithful to Dave Walsh,
and the outlook is that she&rsquo;ll be faithful to him to the
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lon McFane pulled down the top of the blankets and prepared to
crawl in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have her grub hauled to her each year,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;and in general keep an eye on her.&nbsp; Last night
was the first time she ever recognized me, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the we?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;the Count and old
Victor Chauvet and me.&nbsp; Do you know, I think the Count is
the one to be really sorry for.&nbsp; Dave Walsh never did know
that she was false to him.&nbsp; And she does not suffer.&nbsp;
Her darkness is merciful to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay silently under the blankets for the space of a
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Count still in the country?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>But there was a gentle sound of heavy breathing, and I knew
Lon McFane was asleep.</p>
<h2>THE PASSING OF MARCUS O&rsquo;BRIEN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is the judgment of this court that you vamose the
camp . . . in the customary way, sir, in the customary
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge Marcus O&rsquo;Brien was absent-minded, and Mucluc
Charley nudged him in the ribs.&nbsp; Marcus O&rsquo;Brien
cleared his throat and went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weighing the gravity of the offence, sir, and the
extenuating circumstances, it is the opinion of this court, and
its verdict, that you be outfitted with three days&rsquo;
grub.&nbsp; That will do, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona Jack cast a bleak glance out over the Yukon.&nbsp; It
was a swollen, chocolate flood, running a mile wide and nobody
knew how deep.&nbsp; The earth-bank on which he stood was
ordinarily a dozen feet above the water, but the river was now
growling at the top of the bank, devouring, instant by instant,
tiny portions of the top-standing soil.&nbsp; These portions went
into the gaping mouths of the endless army of brown swirls and
vanished away.&nbsp; Several inches more, and Red Cow would be
flooded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Arizona Jack said
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three days&rsquo; grub ain&rsquo;t
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was Manchester,&rdquo; Marcus O&rsquo;Brien
replied gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get any
grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they found his remains grounded on the Lower River
an&rsquo; half eaten by huskies,&rdquo; was Arizona Jack&rsquo;s
retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;And his killin&rsquo; was without
provocation.&nbsp; Joe Deeves never did nothin&rsquo;, never
warbled once, an&rsquo; jes&rsquo; because his stomach was out of
order, Manchester ups an&rsquo; plugs him.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t
givin&rsquo; me a square deal, O&rsquo;Brien, I tell you that
straight.&nbsp; Give me a week&rsquo;s grub, and I play even to
win out.&nbsp; Three days&rsquo; grub, an&rsquo; I cash
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for did you kill Ferguson?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any patience for these
unprovoked killings.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve got to stop.&nbsp;
Red Cow&rsquo;s none so populous.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good camp,
and there never used to be any killings.&nbsp; Now they&rsquo;re
epidemic.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Jack, but you&rsquo;ve
got to be made an example of.&nbsp; Ferguson didn&rsquo;t provoke
enough for a killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provoke!&rdquo; Arizona Jack snorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
tell you, O&rsquo;Brien, you don&rsquo;t savve.&nbsp; You
ain&rsquo;t got no artistic sensibilities.&nbsp; What for did I
kill Ferguson?&nbsp; What for did Ferguson sing &lsquo;Then I
wisht I was a little bird&rsquo;?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want
to know.&nbsp; Answer me that.&nbsp; What for did he sing
&lsquo;little bird, little bird&rsquo;?&nbsp; One little bird was
enough.&nbsp; I could a-stood one little bird.&nbsp; But no, he
must sing two little birds.&nbsp; I gave &rsquo;m a chanst.&nbsp;
I went to him almighty polite and requested him kindly to discard
one little bird.&nbsp; I pleaded with him.&nbsp; There was
witnesses that testified to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; Ferguson was no jay-throated songster,&rdquo;
some one spoke up from the crowd.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien betrayed indecision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t a man got a right to his artistic
feelin&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Arizona Jack demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I gave
Ferguson warnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; It was violatin&rsquo; my own
nature to go on listening to his little birds.&nbsp; Why,
there&rsquo;s music sharps that fine-strung an&rsquo; keyed-up
they&rsquo;d kill for heaps less&rsquo;n I did.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
willin&rsquo; to pay for havin&rsquo; artistic
feelin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I can take my medicine an&rsquo; lick the
spoon, but three days&rsquo; grub is drawin&rsquo; it a shade
fine, that&rsquo;s all, an&rsquo; I hereby register my
kick.&nbsp; Go on with the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien was still wavering.&nbsp; He glanced inquiringly
at Mucluc Charley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say, Judge, that three days&rsquo; grub was a
mite severe,&rdquo; the latter suggested; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re
runnin&rsquo; the show.&nbsp; When we elected you judge of this
here trial court, we agreed to abide by your decisions, an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ve done it, too, b&rsquo;gosh, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to keep on doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe I&rsquo;ve been a trifle harsh, Jack,&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Brien said apologetically&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that
worked up over those killings; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m willing to
make it a week&rsquo;s grub.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cleared his throat
magisterially and looked briskly about him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now
we might as well get along and finish up the business.&nbsp; The
boat&rsquo;s ready.&nbsp; You go and get the grub,
Leclaire.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll settle for it afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona Jack looked grateful, and, muttering something about
&ldquo;damned little birds,&rdquo; stepped aboard the open boat
that rubbed restlessly against the bank.&nbsp; It was a large
skiff, built of rough pine planks that had been sawed by hand
from the standing timber of Lake Linderman, a few hundred miles
above, at the foot of Chilcoot.&nbsp; In the boat were a pair of
oars and Arizona Jack&rsquo;s blankets.&nbsp; Leclaire brought
the grub, tied up in a flour-sack, and put it on board.&nbsp; As
he did so, he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;I gave you good measure,
Jack.&nbsp; You done it with provocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast her off!&rdquo; Arizona Jack cried.</p>
<p>Somebody untied the painter and threw it in.&nbsp; The current
gripped the boat and whirled it away.&nbsp; The murderer did not
bother with the oars, contenting himself with sitting in the
stern-sheets and rolling a cigarette.&nbsp; Completing it, he
struck a match and lighted up.&nbsp; Those that watched on the
bank could see the tiny puffs of smoke.&nbsp; They remained on
the bank till the boat swung out of sight around the bend half a
mile below.&nbsp; Justice had been done.</p>
<p>The denizens of Red Cow imposed the law and executed sentences
without the delays that mark the softness of civilization.&nbsp;
There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for
themselves.&nbsp; They were compelled to make it for
themselves.&nbsp; It was in an early day that Red Cow flourished
on the Yukon&mdash;1887&mdash;and the Klondike and its populous
stampedes lay in the unguessed future.&nbsp; The men of Red Cow
did not even know whether their camp was situated in Alaska or in
the North-west Territory, whether they drew breath under the
stars and stripes or under the British flag.&nbsp; No surveyor
had ever happened along to give them their latitude and
longitude.&nbsp; Red Cow was situated somewhere along the Yukon,
and that was sufficient for them.&nbsp; So far as flags were
concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction.&nbsp; So far as the
law was concerned, they were in No-Man&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>They made their own law, and it was very simple.&nbsp; The
Yukon executed their decrees.&nbsp; Some two thousand miles below
Red Cow the Yukon flowed into Bering Sea through a delta a
hundred miles wide.&nbsp; Every mile of those two thousand miles
was savage wilderness.&nbsp; It was true, where the Porcupine
flowed into the Yukon inside the Arctic Circle there was a Hudson
Bay Company trading post.&nbsp; But that was many hundreds of
miles away.&nbsp; Also, it was rumoured that many hundreds of
miles farther on there were missions.&nbsp; This last, however,
was merely rumour; the men of Red Cow had never been there.&nbsp;
They had entered the lone land by way of Chilcoot and the
head-waters of the Yukon.</p>
<p>The men of Red Cow ignored all minor offences.&nbsp; To be
drunk and disorderly and to use vulgar language were looked upon
as natural and inalienable rights.&nbsp; The men of Red Cow were
individualists, and recognized as sacred but two things, property
and life.&nbsp; There were no women present to complicate their
simple morality.&nbsp; There were only three log-cabins in Red
Cow&mdash;the majority of the population of forty men living in
tents or brush shacks; and there was no jail in which to confine
malefactors, while the inhabitants were too busy digging gold or
seeking gold to take a day off and build a jail.&nbsp; Besides,
the paramount question of grub negatived such a procedure.&nbsp;
Wherefore, when a man violated the rights of property or life, he
was thrown into an open boat and started down the Yukon.&nbsp;
The quantity of grub he received was proportioned to the gravity
of the offence.&nbsp; Thus, a common thief might get as much as
two weeks&rsquo; grub; an uncommon thief might get no more than
half of that.&nbsp; A murderer got no grub at all.&nbsp; A man
found guilty of manslaughter would receive grub for from three
days to a week.&nbsp; And Marcus O&rsquo;Brien had been elected
judge, and it was he who apportioned the grub.&nbsp; A man who
broke the law took his chances.&nbsp; The Yukon swept him away,
and he might or might not win to Bering Sea.&nbsp; A few
days&rsquo; grub gave him a fighting chance.&nbsp; No grub meant
practically capital punishment, though there was a slim chance,
all depending on the season of the year.</p>
<p>Having disposed of Arizona Jack and watched him out of sight,
the population turned from the bank and went to work on its
claims&mdash;all except Curly Jim, who ran the one faro layout in
all the Northland and who speculated in prospect-holes on the
sides.&nbsp; Two things happened that day that were
momentous.&nbsp; In the late morning Marcus O&rsquo;Brien struck
it.&nbsp; He washed out a dollar, a dollar and a half, and two
dollars, from three successive pans.&nbsp; He had found the
streak.&nbsp; Curly Jim looked into the hole, washed a few pans
himself, and offered O&rsquo;Brien ten thousand dollars for all
rights&mdash;five thousand in dust, and, in lieu of the other
five thousand, a half interest in his faro layout.&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Brien refused the offer.&nbsp; He was there to make money
out of the earth, he declared with heat, and not out of his
fellow-men.&nbsp; And anyway, he didn&rsquo;t like faro.&nbsp;
Besides, he appraised his strike at a whole lot more than ten
thousand.</p>
<p>The second event of moment occurred in the afternoon, when
Siskiyou Pearly ran his boat into the bank and tied up.&nbsp; He
was fresh from the Outside, and had in his possession a
four-months-old newspaper.&nbsp; Furthermore, he had half a dozen
barrels of whisky, all consigned to Curly Jim.&nbsp; The men of
Red Cow quit work.&nbsp; They sampled the whisky&mdash;at a
dollar a drink, weighed out on Curly&rsquo;s scales; and they
discussed the news.&nbsp; And all would have been well, had not
Curly Jim conceived a nefarious scheme, which was, namely, first
to get Marcus O&rsquo;Brien drunk, and next, to buy his mine from
him.</p>
<p>The first half of the scheme worked beautifully.&nbsp; It
began in the early evening, and by nine o&rsquo;clock
O&rsquo;Brien had reached the singing stage.&nbsp; He clung with
one arm around Curly Jim&rsquo;s neck, and even essayed the late
lamented Ferguson&rsquo;s song about the little birds.&nbsp; He
considered he was quite safe in this, what of the fact that the
only man in camp with artistic feelings was even then speeding
down the Yukon on the breast of a five-mile current.</p>
<p>But the second half of the scheme failed to connect.&nbsp; No
matter how much whisky was poured down his neck, O&rsquo;Brien
could not be brought to realize that it was his bounden and
friendly duty to sell his claim.&nbsp; He hesitated, it is true,
and trembled now and again on the verge of giving in.&nbsp;
Inside his muddled head, however, he was chuckling to
himself.&nbsp; He was up to Curly Jim&rsquo;s game, and liked the
hands that were being dealt him.&nbsp; The whisky was good.&nbsp;
It came out of one special barrel, and was about a dozen times
better than that in the other five barrels.</p>
<p>Siskiyou Pearly was dispensing drinks in the bar-room to the
remainder of the population of Red Cow, while O&rsquo;Brien and
Curly had out their business orgy in the kitchen.&nbsp; But there
was nothing small about O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; He went into the
bar-room and returned with Mucluc Charley and Percy Leclaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business &rsquo;sociates of mine, business
&rsquo;sociates,&rdquo; he announced, with a broad wink to them
and a guileless grin to Curly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always trust their
judgment, always trust &rsquo;em.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all
right.&nbsp; Give &rsquo;em some fire-water, Curly, an&rsquo;
le&rsquo;s talk it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was ringing in; but Curly Jim, making a swift revaluation
of the claim, and remembering that the last pan he washed had
turned out seven dollars, decided that it was worth the extra
whisky, even if it was selling in the other room at a dollar a
drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to consider,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien
was hiccoughing to his two friends in the course of explaining to
them the question at issue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who?&nbsp;
Me?&mdash;sell for ten thousand dollars!&nbsp; No indeed.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll dig the gold myself, an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; down to God&rsquo;s country&mdash;Southern
California&mdash;that&rsquo;s the place for me to end my
declinin&rsquo; days&mdash;an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll start . . .
as I said before, then I&rsquo;ll start . . . what did I say I
was goin&rsquo; to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ostrich farm,&rdquo; Mucluc Charley volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, just what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
start.&rdquo;&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien abruptly steadied himself and
looked with awe at Mucluc Charley.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you
know?&nbsp; Never said so.&nbsp; Jes&rsquo; thought I said
so.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a min&rsquo; reader, Charley.&nbsp;
Le&rsquo;s have another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curly Jim filled the glasses and had the pleasure of seeing
four dollars&rsquo; worth of whisky disappear, one dollar&rsquo;s
worth of which he punished himself&mdash;O&rsquo;Brien insisted
that he should drink as frequently as his guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take the money now,&rdquo; Leclaire
argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take you two years to dig it out the hole,
an&rsquo; all that time you might be hatchin&rsquo; teeny little
baby ostriches an&rsquo; pulling feathers out the big
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien considered the proposition and nodded
approval.&nbsp; Curly Jim looked gratefully at Leclaire and
refilled the glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there!&rdquo; spluttered Mucluc Charley, whose
tongue was beginning to wag loosely and trip over itself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As your father confessor&mdash;there I go&mdash;as your
brother&mdash;O hell!&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and collected
himself for another start.&nbsp; &ldquo;As your
frien&rsquo;&mdash;business frien&rsquo;, I should say, I would
suggest, rather&mdash;I would take the liberty, as it was, to
mention&mdash;I mean, suggest, that there may be more ostriches .
. . O hell!&rdquo;&nbsp; He downed another glass, and went on
more carefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m drivin&rsquo; at is .
. . what am I drivin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;&nbsp; He smote the side of
his head sharply half a dozen times with the heel of his palm to
shake up his ideas.&nbsp; &ldquo;I got it!&rdquo; he cried
jubilantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Supposen there&rsquo;s slathers
more&rsquo;n ten thousand dollars in that hole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien, who apparently was all ready to close the
bargain, switched about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Splen&rsquo;d
idea.&nbsp; Never thought of it all by myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
took Mucluc Charley warmly by the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
frien&rsquo;!&nbsp; Good &rsquo;s&rsquo;ciate!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned belligerently on Curly Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe hundred
thousand dollars in that hole.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t rob your
old frien&rsquo;, would you, Curly?&nbsp; Course you
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I know you&mdash;better&rsquo;n yourself,
better&rsquo;n yourself.&nbsp; Le&rsquo;s have another:
We&rsquo;re good frien&rsquo;s, all of us, I say, all of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it went, and so went the whisky, and so went Curly
Jim&rsquo;s hopes up and down.&nbsp; Now Leclaire argued in
favour of immediate sale, and almost won the reluctant
O&rsquo;Brien over, only to lose him to the more brilliant
counter-argument of Mucluc Charley.&nbsp; And again, it was
Mucluc Charley who presented convincing reasons for the sale and
Percy Leclaire who held stubbornly back.&nbsp; A little later it
was O&rsquo;Brien himself who insisted on selling, while both
friends, with tears and curses, strove to dissuade him.&nbsp; The
more whiskey they downed, the more fertile of imagination they
became.&nbsp; For one sober pro or con they found a score of
drunken ones; and they convinced one another so readily that they
were perpetually changing sides in the argument.</p>
<p>The time came when both Mucluc Charley and Leclaire were
firmly set upon the sale, and they gleefully obliterated
O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s objections as fast as he entered
them.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien grew desperate.&nbsp; He exhausted his
last argument and sat speechless.&nbsp; He looked pleadingly at
the friends who had deserted him.&nbsp; He kicked Mucluc
Charley&rsquo;s shins under the table, but that graceless hero
immediately unfolded a new and most logical reason for the
sale.&nbsp; Curly Jim got pen and ink and paper and wrote out the
bill of sale.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien sat with pen poised in
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&rsquo;s have one more,&rdquo; he pleaded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One more before I sign away a hundred thousan&rsquo;
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curly Jim filled the glasses triumphantly.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Brien
downed his drink and bent forward with wobbling pen to affix his
signature.&nbsp; Before he had made more than a blot, he suddenly
started up, impelled by the impact of an idea colliding with his
consciousness.&nbsp; He stood upon his feet and swayed back and
forth before them, reflecting in his startled eyes the thought
process that was taking place behind.&nbsp; Then he reached his
conclusion.&nbsp; A benevolent radiance suffused his
countenance.&nbsp; He turned to the faro dealer, took his hand,
and spoke solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curly, you&rsquo;re my frien&rsquo;.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s my han&rsquo;.&nbsp; Shake.&nbsp; Ol&rsquo; man, I
won&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t sell.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t rob
a frien&rsquo;.&nbsp; No son-of-a-gun will ever have chance to
say Marcus O&rsquo;Brien robbed frien&rsquo; cause frien&rsquo;
was drunk.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re drunk, Curly, an&rsquo; I
won&rsquo;t rob you.&nbsp; Jes&rsquo; had thought&mdash;never
thought it before&mdash;don&rsquo;t know what the matter
&rsquo;ith me, but never thought it before.&nbsp; Suppose,
jes&rsquo; suppose, Curly, my ol&rsquo; frien&rsquo;, jes&rsquo;
suppose there ain&rsquo;t ten thousan&rsquo; in whole damn
claim.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be robbed.&nbsp; No, sir; won&rsquo;t do
it.&nbsp; Marcus O&rsquo;Brien makes money out of the
groun&rsquo;, not out of his frien&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Leclaire and Mucluc Charley drowned the faro
dealer&rsquo;s objections in applause for so noble a
sentiment.&nbsp; They fell upon O&rsquo;Brien from either side,
their arms lovingly about his neck, their mouths so full of words
they could not hear Curly&rsquo;s offer to insert a clause in the
document to the effect that if there weren&rsquo;t ten thousand
in the claim he would be given back the difference between yield
and purchase price.&nbsp; The longer they talked the more maudlin
and the more noble the discussion became.&nbsp; All sordid
motives were banished.&nbsp; They were a trio of philanthropists
striving to save Curly Jim from himself and his own
philanthropy.&nbsp; They insisted that he was a
philanthropist.&nbsp; They refused to accept for a moment that
there could be found one ignoble thought in all the world.&nbsp;
They crawled and climbed and scrambled over high ethical plateaux
and ranges, or drowned themselves in metaphysical seas of
sentimentality.</p>
<p>Curly Jim sweated and fumed and poured out the whisky.&nbsp;
He found himself with a score of arguments on his hands, not one
of which had anything to do with the gold-mine he wanted to
buy.&nbsp; The longer they talked the farther away they got from
that gold-mine, and at two in the morning Curly Jim acknowledged
himself beaten.&nbsp; One by one he led his helpless guests
across the kitchen floor and thrust them outside.&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Brien came last, and the three, with arms locked for
mutual aid, titubated gravely on the stoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good business man, Curly,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien was
saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Must say like your style&mdash;fine
an&rsquo; generous, free-handed hospital . . . hospital . . .
hospitality.&nbsp; Credit to you.&nbsp; Nothin&rsquo; base
&rsquo;n graspin&rsquo; in your make-up.&nbsp; As I was
sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then the faro dealer slammed the door.</p>
<p>The three laughed happily on the stoop.&nbsp; They laughed for
a long time.&nbsp; Then Mucluc Charley essayed speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny&mdash;laughed so hard&mdash;ain&rsquo;t what I
want to say.&nbsp; My idea is . . . what wash it?&nbsp; Oh, got
it!&nbsp; Funny how ideas slip.&nbsp; Elusive
idea&mdash;chasin&rsquo; elusive idea&mdash;great sport.&nbsp;
Ever chase rabbits, Percy, my frien&rsquo;?&nbsp; I had
dog&mdash;great rabbit dog.&nbsp; Whash &rsquo;is name?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t know name&mdash;never had no name&mdash;forget
name&mdash;elusive name&mdash;chasin&rsquo; elusive
name&mdash;no, idea&mdash;elusive idea, but got it&mdash;what I
want to say was&mdash;O hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter there was silence for a long time.&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Brien slipped from their arms to a sitting posture on the
stoop, where he slept gently.&nbsp; Mucluc Charley chased the
elusive idea through all the nooks and crannies of his drowning
consciousness.&nbsp; Leclaire hung fascinated upon the delayed
utterance.&nbsp; Suddenly the other&rsquo;s hand smote him on the
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; Mucluc Charley cried in stentorian
tones.</p>
<p>The shock of the jolt broke the continuity of Leclaire&rsquo;s
mental process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much to the pan?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pan nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Mucluc Charley was
angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Idea&mdash;got it&mdash;got
leg-hold&mdash;ran it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leclaire&rsquo;s face took on a rapt, admiring expression, and
again he hung upon the other&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . O hell!&rdquo; said Mucluc Charley.</p>
<p>At this moment the kitchen door opened for an instant, and
Curly Jim shouted, &ldquo;Go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; said Mucluc Charley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shame
idea&mdash;very shame as mine.&nbsp; Le&rsquo;s go
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gathered O&rsquo;Brien up between them and started.&nbsp;
Mucluc Charley began aloud the pursuit of another idea.&nbsp;
Leclaire followed the pursuit with enthusiasm.&nbsp; But
O&rsquo;Brien did not follow it.&nbsp; He neither heard, nor saw,
nor knew anything.&nbsp; He was a mere wobbling automaton,
supported affectionately and precariously by his two business
associates.</p>
<p>They took the path down by the bank of the Yukon.&nbsp; Home
did not lie that way, but the elusive idea did.&nbsp; Mucluc
Charley giggled over the idea that he could not catch for the
edification of Leclaire.&nbsp; They came to where Siskiyou
Pearly&rsquo;s boat lay moored to the bank.&nbsp; The rope with
which it was tied ran across the path to a pine stump.&nbsp; They
tripped over it and went down, O&rsquo;Brien underneath.&nbsp; A
faint flash of consciousness lighted his brain.&nbsp; He felt the
impact of bodies upon his and struck out madly for a moment with
his fists.&nbsp; Then he went to sleep again.&nbsp; His gentle
snore arose on the air, and Mucluc Charley began to giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New idea,&rdquo; he volunteered, &ldquo;brand new
idea.&nbsp; Jes&rsquo; caught it&mdash;no trouble at all.&nbsp;
Came right up an&rsquo; I patted it on the head.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
mine.&nbsp; &rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s drunk&mdash;beashly drunk.&nbsp;
Shame&mdash;damn shame&mdash;learn&rsquo;m lesshon.&nbsp; Trash
Pearly&rsquo;s boat.&nbsp; Put &rsquo;Brien in Pearly&rsquo;s
boat.&nbsp; Casht off&mdash;let her go down Yukon.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Brien wake up in mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Current too
strong&mdash;can&rsquo;t row boat &rsquo;gainst
current&mdash;mush walk back.&nbsp; Come back madder &rsquo;n
hatter.&nbsp; You an&rsquo; me headin&rsquo; for tall
timber.&nbsp; Learn &rsquo;m lesshon jes&rsquo; shame, learn
&rsquo;m lesshon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siskiyou Pearly&rsquo;s boat was empty, save for a pair of
oars.&nbsp; Its gunwale rubbed against the bank alongside of
O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; They rolled him over into it.&nbsp; Mucluc
Charley cast off the painter, and Leclaire shoved the boat out
into the current.&nbsp; Then, exhausted by their labours, they
lay down on the bank and slept.</p>
<p>Next morning all Red Cow knew of the joke that had been played
on Marcus O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; There were some tall bets as to
what would happen to the two perpetrators when the victim arrived
back.&nbsp; In the afternoon a lookout was set, so that they
would know when he was sighted.&nbsp; Everybody wanted to see him
come in.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t come, though they sat up till
midnight.&nbsp; Nor did he come next day, nor the next.&nbsp; Red
Cow never saw Marcus O&rsquo;Brien again, and though many
conjectures were entertained, no certain clue was ever gained to
dispel the mystery of his passing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Only Marcus O&rsquo;Brien knew, and he never came back to
tell.&nbsp; He awoke next morning in torment.&nbsp; His stomach
had been calcined by the inordinate quantity of whisky he had
drunk, and was a dry and raging furnace.&nbsp; His head ached all
over, inside and out; and, worse than that, was the pain in his
face.&nbsp; For six hours countless thousands of mosquitoes had
fed upon him, and their ungrateful poison had swollen his face
tremendously.&nbsp; It was only by a severe exertion of will that
he was able to open narrow slits in his face through which he
could peer.&nbsp; He happened to move his hands, and they
hurt.&nbsp; He squinted at them, but failed to recognize them, so
puffed were they by the mosquito virus.&nbsp; He was lost, or
rather, his identity was lost to him.&nbsp; There was nothing
familiar about him, which, by association of ideas, would cause
to rise in his consciousness the continuity of his
existence.&nbsp; He was divorced utterly from his past, for there
was nothing about him to resurrect in his consciousness a memory
of that past.&nbsp; Besides, he was so sick and miserable that he
lacked energy and inclination to seek after who and what he
was.</p>
<p>It was not until he discovered a crook in a little finger,
caused by an unset breakage of years before, that he knew himself
to be Marcus O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; On the instant his past rushed
into his consciousness.&nbsp; When he discovered a blood-blister
under a thumb-nail, which he had received the previous week, his
self-identification became doubly sure, and he knew that those
unfamiliar hands belonged to Marcus O&rsquo;Brien, or, just as
much to the point, that Marcus O&rsquo;Brien belonged to the
hands.&nbsp; His first thought was that he was ill&mdash;that he
had had river fever.&nbsp; It hurt him so much to open his eyes
that he kept them closed.&nbsp; A small floating branch struck
the boat a sharp rap.&nbsp; He thought it was some one knocking
on the cabin door, and said, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
waited for a while, and then said testily, &ldquo;Stay out, then,
damn you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But just the same he wished they would
come in and tell him about his illness.</p>
<p>But as he lay there, the past night began to reconstruct
itself in his brain.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t been sick at all, was
his thought; he had merely been drunk, and it was time for him to
get up and go to work.&nbsp; Work suggested his mine, and he
remembered that he had refused ten thousand dollars for it.&nbsp;
He sat up abruptly and squeezed open his eyes.&nbsp; He saw
himself in a boat, floating on the swollen brown flood of the
Yukon.&nbsp; The spruce-covered shores and islands were
unfamiliar.&nbsp; He was stunned for a time.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t make it out.&nbsp; He could remember the last
night&rsquo;s orgy, but there was no connection between that and
his present situation.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and held his aching head in his
hands.&nbsp; What had happened?&nbsp; Slowly the dreadful thought
arose in his mind.&nbsp; He fought against it, strove to drive it
away, but it persisted: he had killed somebody.&nbsp; That alone
could explain why he was in an open boat drifting down the
Yukon.&nbsp; The law of Red Cow that he had so long administered
had now been administered to him.&nbsp; He had killed some one
and been set adrift.&nbsp; But whom?&nbsp; He racked his aching
brain for the answer, but all that came was a vague memory of
bodies falling upon him and of striking out at them.&nbsp; Who
were they?&nbsp; Maybe he had killed more than one.&nbsp; He
reached to his belt.&nbsp; The knife was missing from its
sheath.&nbsp; He had done it with that undoubtedly.&nbsp; But
there must have been some reason for the killing.&nbsp; He opened
his eyes and in a panic began to search about the boat.&nbsp;
There was no grub, not an ounce of grub.&nbsp; He sat down with a
groan.&nbsp; He had killed without provocation.&nbsp; The extreme
rigour of the law had been visited upon him.</p>
<p>For half an hour he remained motionless, holding his aching
head and trying to think.&nbsp; Then he cooled his stomach with a
drink of water from overside and felt better.&nbsp; He stood up,
and alone on the wide-stretching Yukon, with naught but the
primeval wilderness to hear, he cursed strong drink.&nbsp; After
that he tied up to a huge floating pine that was deeper sunk in
the current than the boat and that consequently drifted
faster.&nbsp; He washed his face and hands, sat down in the
stern-sheets, and did some more thinking.&nbsp; It was late in
June.&nbsp; It was two thousand miles to Bering Sea.&nbsp; The
boat was averaging five miles an hour.&nbsp; There was no
darkness in such high latitudes at that time of the year, and he
could run the river every hour of the twenty-four.&nbsp; This
would mean, daily, a hundred and twenty miles.&nbsp; Strike out
the twenty for accidents, and there remained a hundred miles a
day.&nbsp; In twenty days he would reach Bering Sea.&nbsp; And
this would involve no expenditure of energy; the river did the
work.&nbsp; He could lie down in the bottom of the boat and
husband his strength.</p>
<p>For two days he ate nothing.&nbsp; Then, drifting into the
Yukon Flats, he went ashore on the low-lying islands and gathered
the eggs of wild geese and ducks.&nbsp; He had no matches, and
ate the eggs raw.&nbsp; They were strong, but they kept him
going.&nbsp; When he crossed the Arctic Circle, he found the
Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s post.&nbsp; The brigade had not yet
arrived from the Mackenzie, and the post was completely out of
grub.&nbsp; He was offered wild-duck eggs, but he informed them
that he had a bushel of the same on the boat.&nbsp; He was also
offered a drink of whisky, which he refused with an exhibition of
violent repugnance.&nbsp; He got matches, however, and after that
he cooked his eggs.&nbsp; Toward the mouth of the river
head-winds delayed him, and he was twenty-four days on the egg
diet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, while asleep he had drifted by both
the missions of St. Paul and Holy Cross.&nbsp; And he could
sincerely say, as he afterward did, that talk about missions on
the Yukon was all humbug.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t any missions,
and he was the man to know.</p>
<p>Once on Bering Sea he exchanged the egg diet for seal diet,
and he never could make up his mind which he liked least.&nbsp;
In the fall of the year he was rescued by a United States revenue
cutter, and the following winter he made quite a hit in San
Francisco as a temperance lecturer.&nbsp; In this field he found
his vocation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Avoid the bottle&rdquo; is his slogan
and battle-cry.&nbsp; He manages subtly to convey the impression
that in his own life a great disaster was wrought by the
bottle.&nbsp; He has even mentioned the loss of a fortune that
was caused by that hell-bait of the devil, but behind that
incident his listeners feel the loom of some terrible and
unguessed evil for which the bottle is responsible.&nbsp; He has
made a success in his vocation, and has grown grey and respected
in the crusade against strong drink.&nbsp; But on the Yukon the
passing of Marcus O&rsquo;Brien remains tradition.&nbsp; It is a
mystery that ranks at par with the disappearance of Sir John
Franklin.</p>
<h2>THE WIT OF PORPORTUK</h2>
<p>El-Soo had been a Mission girl.&nbsp; Her mother had died when
she was very small, and Sister Alberta had plucked El-Soo as a
brand from the burning, one summer day, and carried her away to
Holy Cross Mission and dedicated her to God.&nbsp; El-Soo was a
full-blooded Indian, yet she exceeded all the half-breed and
quarter-breed girls.&nbsp; Never had the good sisters dealt with
a girl so adaptable and at the same time so spirited.</p>
<p>El-Soo was quick, and deft, and intelligent; but above all she
was fire, the living flame of life, a blaze of personality that
was compounded of will, sweetness, and daring.&nbsp; Her father
was a chief, and his blood ran in her veins.&nbsp; Obedience, on
the part of El-Soo, was a matter of terms and arrangement.&nbsp;
She had a passion for equity, and perhaps it was because of this
that she excelled in mathematics.</p>
<p>But she excelled in other things.&nbsp; She learned to read
and write English as no girl had ever learned in the
Mission.&nbsp; She led the girls in singing, and into song she
carried her sense of equity.&nbsp; She was an artist, and the
fire of her flowed toward creation.&nbsp; Had she from birth
enjoyed a more favourable environment, she would have made
literature or music.</p>
<p>Instead, she was El-Soo, daughter of Klakee-Nah, a chief, and
she lived in the Holy Cross Mission where were no artists, but
only pure-souled Sisters who were interested in cleanliness and
righteousness and the welfare of the spirit in the land of
immortality that lay beyond the skies.</p>
<p>The years passed.&nbsp; She was eight years old when she
entered the Mission; she was sixteen, and the Sisters were
corresponding with their superiors in the Order concerning the
sending of El-Soo to the United States to complete her education,
when a man of her own tribe arrived at Holy Cross and had talk
with her.&nbsp; El-Soo was somewhat appalled by him.&nbsp; He was
dirty.&nbsp; He was a Caliban-like creature, primitively ugly,
with a mop of hair that had never been combed.&nbsp; He looked at
her disapprovingly and refused to sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy brother is dead,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>El-Soo was not particularly shocked.&nbsp; She remembered
little of her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy father is an old man, and
alone,&rdquo; the messenger went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;His house is
large and empty, and he would hear thy voice and look upon
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Him she remembered&mdash;Klakee-Nah, the headman of the
village, the friend of the missionaries and the traders, a large
man thewed like a giant, with kindly eyes and masterful ways, and
striding with a consciousness of crude royalty in his
carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him that I will come,&rdquo; was El-Soo&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<p>Much to the despair of the Sisters, the brand plucked from the
burning went back to the burning.&nbsp; All pleading with El-Soo
was vain.&nbsp; There was much argument, expostulation, and
weeping.&nbsp; Sister Alberta even revealed to her the project of
sending her to the United States.&nbsp; El-Soo stared wide-eyed
into the golden vista thus opened up to her, and shook her
head.&nbsp; In her eyes persisted another vista.&nbsp; It was the
mighty curve of the Yukon at Tana-naw Station.&nbsp; With the St.
George Mission on one side, and the trading post on the other,
and midway between the Indian village and a certain large log
house where lived an old man tended upon by slaves.</p>
<p>All dwellers on the Yukon bank for twice a thousand miles knew
the large log house, the old man and the tending slaves; and well
did the Sisters know the house, its unending revelry, its
feasting and its fun.&nbsp; So there was weeping at Holy Cross
when El-Soo departed.</p>
<p>There was a great cleaning up in the large house when El-Soo
arrived.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah, himself masterful, protested at this
masterful conduct of his young daughter; but in the end, dreaming
barbarically of magnificence, he went forth and borrowed a
thousand dollars from old Porportuk, than whom there was no
richer Indian on the Yukon.&nbsp; Also, Klakee-Nah ran up a heavy
bill at the trading post.&nbsp; El-Soo re-created the large
house.&nbsp; She invested it with new splendour, while Klakee-Nah
maintained its ancient traditions of hospitality and revelry.</p>
<p>All this was unusual for a Yukon Indian, but Klakee-Nah was an
unusual Indian.&nbsp; Not alone did he like to render inordinate
hospitality, but, what of being a chief and of acquiring much
money, he was able to do it.&nbsp; In the primitive trading days
he had been a power over his people, and he had dealt profitably
with the white trading companies.&nbsp; Later on, with Porportuk,
he had made a gold-strike on the Koyokuk River.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah
was by training and nature an aristocrat.&nbsp; Porportuk was
bourgeois, and Porportuk bought him out of the gold-mine.&nbsp;
Porportuk was content to plod and accumulate.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah
went back to his large house and proceeded to spend.&nbsp;
Porportuk was known as the richest Indian in Alaska.&nbsp;
Klakee-Nah was known as the whitest.&nbsp; Porportuk was a
money-lender and a usurer.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah was an
anachronism&mdash;a medi&aelig;val ruin, a fighter and a feaster,
happy with wine and song.</p>
<p>El-Soo adapted herself to the large house and its ways as
readily as she had adapted herself to Holy Cross Mission and its
ways.&nbsp; She did not try to reform her father and direct his
footsteps toward God.&nbsp; It is true, she reproved him when he
drank overmuch and profoundly, but that was for the sake of his
health and the direction of his footsteps on solid earth.</p>
<p>The latchstring to the large house was always out.&nbsp; What
with the coming and the going, it was never still.&nbsp; The
rafters of the great living-room shook with the roar of wassail
and of song.&nbsp; At table sat men from all the world and chiefs
from distant tribes&mdash;Englishmen and Colonials, lean Yankee
traders and rotund officials of the great companies, cowboys from
the Western ranges, sailors from the sea, hunters and dog-mushers
of a score of nationalities.</p>
<p>El-Soo drew breath in a cosmopolitan atmosphere.&nbsp; She
could speak English as well as she could her native tongue, and
she sang English songs and ballads.&nbsp; The passing Indian
ceremonials she knew, and the perishing traditions.&nbsp; The
tribal dress of the daughter of a chief she knew how to wear upon
occasion.&nbsp; But for the most part she dressed as white women
dress.&nbsp; Not for nothing was her needlework at the Mission
and her innate artistry.&nbsp; She carried her clothes like a
white woman, and she made clothes that could be so carried.</p>
<p>In her way she was as unusual as her father, and the position
she occupied was as unique as his.&nbsp; She was the one Indian
woman who was the social equal with the several white women at
Tana-naw Station.&nbsp; She was the one Indian woman to whom
white men honourably made proposals of marriage.&nbsp; And she
was the one Indian woman whom no white man ever insulted.</p>
<p>For El-Soo was beautiful&mdash;not as white women are
beautiful, not as Indian women are beautiful.&nbsp; It was the
flame of her, that did not depend upon feature, that was her
beauty.&nbsp; So far as mere line and feature went, she was the
classic Indian type.&nbsp; The black hair and the fine bronze
were hers, and the black eyes, brilliant and bold, keen as
sword-light, proud; and hers the delicate eagle nose with the
thin, quivering nostrils, the high cheek-bones that were not
broad apart, and the thin lips that were not too thin.&nbsp; But
over all and through all poured the flame of her&mdash;the
unanalysable something that was fire and that was the soul of
her, that lay mellow-warm or blazed in her eyes, that sprayed the
cheeks of her, that distended the nostrils, that curled the lips,
or, when the lip was in repose, that was still there in the lip,
the lip palpitant with its presence.</p>
<p>And El-Soo had wit&mdash;rarely sharp to hurt, yet quick to
search out forgivable weakness.&nbsp; The laughter of her mind
played like lambent flame over all about her, and from all about
her arose answering laughter.&nbsp; Yet she was never the centre
of things.&nbsp; This she would not permit.&nbsp; The large
house, and all of which it was significant, was her
father&rsquo;s; and through it, to the last, moved his heroic
figure&mdash;host, master of the revels, and giver of the
law.&nbsp; It is true, as the strength oozed from him, that she
caught up responsibilities from his failing hands.&nbsp; But in
appearance he still ruled, dozing, ofttimes at the board, a
bacchanalian ruin, yet in all seeming the ruler of the feast.</p>
<p>And through the large house moved the figure of Porportuk,
ominous, with shaking head, coldly disapproving, paying for it
all.&nbsp; Not that he really paid, for he compounded interest in
weird ways, and year by year absorbed the properties of
Klakee-Nah.&nbsp; Porportuk once took it upon himself to chide
El-Soo upon the wasteful way of life in the large house&mdash;it
was when he had about absorbed the last of Klakee-Nah&rsquo;s
wealth&mdash;but he never ventured so to chide again.&nbsp;
El-Soo, like her father, was an aristocrat, as disdainful of
money as he, and with an equal sense of honour as finely
strung.</p>
<p>Porportuk continued grudgingly to advance money, and ever the
money flowed in golden foam away.&nbsp; Upon one thing El-Soo was
resolved&mdash;her father should die as he had lived.&nbsp; There
should be for him no passing from high to low, no diminution of
the revels, no lessening of the lavish hospitality.&nbsp; When
there was famine, as of old, the Indians came groaning to the
large house and went away content.&nbsp; When there was famine
and no money, money was borrowed from Porportuk, and the Indians
still went away content.&nbsp; El-Soo might well have repeated,
after the aristocrats of another time and place, that after her
came the deluge.&nbsp; In her case the deluge was old
Porportuk.&nbsp; With every advance of money, he looked upon her
with a more possessive eye, and felt bourgeoning within him
ancient fires.</p>
<p>But El-Soo had no eyes for him.&nbsp; Nor had she eyes for the
white men who wanted to marry her at the Mission with ring and
priest and book.&nbsp; For at Tana-naw Station was a young man,
Akoon, of her own blood, and tribe, and village.&nbsp; He was
strong and beautiful to her eyes, a great hunter, and, in that he
had wandered far and much, very poor; he had been to all the
unknown wastes and places; he had journeyed to Sitka and to the
United States; he had crossed the continent to Hudson Bay and
back again, and as seal-hunter on a ship he had sailed to Siberia
and for Japan.</p>
<p>When he returned from the gold-strike in Klondike he came, as
was his wont, to the large house to make report to old Klakee-Nah
of all the world that he had seen; and there he first saw El-Soo,
three years back from the Mission.&nbsp; Thereat, Akoon wandered
no more.&nbsp; He refused a wage of twenty dollars a day as pilot
on the big steamboats.&nbsp; He hunted some and fished some, but
never far from Tana-naw Station, and he was at the large house
often and long.&nbsp; And El-Soo measured him against many men
and found him good.&nbsp; He sang songs to her, and was ardent
and glowed until all Tana-naw Station knew he loved her.&nbsp;
And Porportuk but grinned and advanced more money for the upkeep
of the large house.</p>
<p>Then came the death table of Klakee-Nah.</p>
<p>He sat at feast, with death in his throat, that he could not
drown with wine.&nbsp; And laughter and joke and song went
around, and Akoon told a story that made the rafters echo.&nbsp;
There were no tears or sighs at that table.&nbsp; It was no more
than fit that Klakee-Nah should die as he had lived, and none
knew this better than El-Soo, with her artist sympathy.&nbsp; The
old roystering crowd was there, and, as of old, three
frost-bitten sailors were there, fresh from the long traverse
from the Arctic, survivors of a ship&rsquo;s company of
seventy-four.&nbsp; At Klakee-Nah&rsquo;s back were four old men,
all that were left him of the slaves of his youth.&nbsp; With
rheumy eyes they saw to his needs, with palsied hands filling his
glass or striking him on the back between the shoulders when
death stirred and he coughed and gasped.</p>
<p>It was a wild night, and as the hours passed and the fun
laughed and roared along, death stirred more restlessly in
Klakee-Nah&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; Then it was that he sent for
Porportuk.&nbsp; And Porportuk came in from the outside frost to
look with disapproving eyes upon the meat and wine on the table
for which he had paid.&nbsp; But as he looked down the length of
flushed faces to the far end and saw the face of El-Soo, the
light in his eyes flared up, and for a moment the disapproval
vanished.</p>
<p>Place was made for him at Klakee-Nah&rsquo;s side, and a glass
placed before him.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah, with his own hands, filled
the glass with fervent spirits.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Porportuk&rsquo;s eyes watered as he nodded his head and
smacked his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, in your own house, have you had such
drink?&rdquo; Klakee-Nah demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not deny that the drink is good to this old
throat of mine,&rdquo; Porportuk made answer, and hesitated for
the speech to complete the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it costs overmuch,&rdquo; Klakee-Nah roared,
completing it for him.</p>
<p>Porportuk winced at the laughter that went down the
table.&nbsp; His eyes burned malevolently.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were
boys together, of the same age,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
your throat is death.&nbsp; I am still alive and
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ominous murmur arose from the company.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah
coughed and strangled, and the old slaves smote him between the
shoulders.&nbsp; He emerged gasping, and waved his hand to still
the threatening rumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have grudged the very fire in your house because
the wood cost overmuch!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
grudged life.&nbsp; To live cost overmuch, and you have refused
to pay the price.&nbsp; Your life has been like a cabin where the
fire is out and there are no blankets on the floor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He signalled to a slave to fill his glass, which he held
aloft.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have lived.&nbsp; And I have been warm
with life as you have never been warm.&nbsp; It is true, you
shall live long.&nbsp; But the longest nights are the cold nights
when a man shivers and lies awake.&nbsp; My nights have been
short, but I have slept warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drained the glass.&nbsp; The shaking hand of a slave failed
to catch it as it crashed to the floor.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah sank
back, panting, watching the upturned glasses at the lips of the
drinkers, his own lips slightly smiling to the applause.&nbsp; At
a sign, two slaves attempted to help him sit upright again.&nbsp;
But they were weak, his frame was mighty, and the four old men
tottered and shook as they helped him forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But manner of life is neither here nor there,&rdquo; he
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have other business, Porportuk, you and
I, to-night.&nbsp; Debts are mischances, and I am in mischance
with you.&nbsp; What of my debt, and how great is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porportuk searched in his pouch and brought forth a
memorandum.&nbsp; He sipped at his glass and began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is the note of August, 1889, for three hundred
dollars.&nbsp; The interest has never been paid.&nbsp; And the
note of the next year for five hundred dollars.&nbsp; This note
was included in the note of two months later for a thousand
dollars.&nbsp; Then there is the note&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the many notes!&rdquo; Klakee-Nah cried out
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;They make my head go around and all the
things inside my head.&nbsp; The whole!&nbsp; The round
whole!&nbsp; How much is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porportuk referred to his memorandum.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifteen
thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven dollars and seventy-five
cents,&rdquo; he read with careful precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it sixteen thousand, make it sixteen
thousand,&rdquo; Klakee-Nah said grandly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Odd
numbers were ever a worry.&nbsp; And now&mdash;and it is for this
that I have sent for you&mdash;make me out a new note for sixteen
thousand, which I shall sign.&nbsp; I have no thought of the
interest.&nbsp; Make it as large as you will, and make it payable
in the next world, when I shall meet you by the fire of the Great
Father of all Indians.&nbsp; Then the note will be paid.&nbsp;
This I promise you.&nbsp; It is the word of
Klakee-Nah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porportuk looked perplexed, and loudly the laughter arose and
shook the room.&nbsp; Klakee-Nah raised his hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not a joke.&nbsp;
I but speak in fairness.&nbsp; It was for this I sent for you,
Porportuk.&nbsp; Make out the note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no dealings with the next world,&rdquo;
Porportuk made answer slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no thought to meet me before the Great
Father!&rdquo; Klakee-Nah demanded.&nbsp; Then he added, &ldquo;I
shall surely be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no dealings with the next world,&rdquo;
Porportuk repeated sourly.</p>
<p>The dying man regarded him with frank amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know naught of the next world,&rdquo; Porportuk
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do business in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klakee-Nah&rsquo;s face cleared.&nbsp; &ldquo;This comes of
sleeping cold of nights,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; He pondered for
a space, then said, &ldquo;It is in this world that you must be
paid.&nbsp; There remains to me this house.&nbsp; Take it, and
burn the debt in the candle there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an old house and not worth the money,&rdquo;
Porportuk made answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are my mines on the Twisted Salmon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have never paid to work,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is my share in the steamer <i>Koyokuk</i>.&nbsp;
I am half owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is at the bottom of the Yukon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klakee-Nah started.&nbsp; &ldquo;True, I forgot.&nbsp; It was
last spring when the ice went out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He mused for a
time while the glasses remained untasted, and all the company
waited upon his utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would seem I owe you a sum of money which I
cannot pay . . . in this world?&rdquo;&nbsp; Porportuk nodded and
glanced down the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would seem that you, Porportuk, are a poor
business man,&rdquo; Klakee-Nah said slyly.&nbsp; And boldly
Porportuk made answer, &ldquo;No; there is security yet
untouched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Klakee-Nah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I
still property?&nbsp; Name it, and it is yours, and the debt is
no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Porportuk pointed at
El-Soo.</p>
<p>Klakee-Nah could not understand.&nbsp; He peered down the
table, brushed his eyes, and peered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter, El-Soo&mdash;her will I take and the
debt be no more.&nbsp; I will burn the debt there in the
candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klakee-Nah&rsquo;s great chest began to heave.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ho! ho!&mdash;a joke.&nbsp; Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; he laughed
Homerically.&nbsp; &ldquo;And with your cold bed and daughters
old enough to be the mother of El-Soo!&nbsp; Ho! ho!
ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; He began to cough and strangle, and the old
slaves smote him on the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; he
began again, and went off into another paroxysm.</p>
<p>Porportuk waited patiently, sipping from his glass and
studying the double row of faces down the board.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is no joke,&rdquo; he said finally.&nbsp; &ldquo;My speech is
well meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klakee-Nah sobered and looked at him, then reached for his
glass, but could not touch it.&nbsp; A slave passed it to him,
and glass and liquor he flung into the face of Porportuk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn him out!&rdquo; Klakee-Nah thundered to the
waiting table that strained like a pack of hounds in leash.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And roll him in the snow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the mad riot swept past him and out of doors, he signalled
to the slaves, and the four tottering old men supported him on
his feet as he met the returning revellers, upright, glass in
hand, pledging them a toast to the short night when a man sleeps
warm.</p>
<p>It did not take long to settle the estate of Klakee-Nah.&nbsp;
Tommy, the little Englishman, clerk at the trading post, was
called in by El-Soo to help.&nbsp; There was nothing but debts,
notes overdue, mortgaged properties, and properties mortgaged but
worthless.&nbsp; Notes and mortgages were held by
Porportuk.&nbsp; Tommy called him a robber many times as he
pondered the compounding of the interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a debt, Tommy?&rdquo; El-Soo asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a robbery,&rdquo; Tommy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, it is a debt,&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>The winter wore away, and the early spring, and still the
claims of Porportuk remained unpaid.&nbsp; He saw El-Soo often
and explained to her at length, as he had explained to her
father, the way the debt could be cancelled.&nbsp; Also, he
brought with him old medicine-men, who elaborated to her the
everlasting damnation of her father if the debt were not
paid.&nbsp; One day, after such an elaboration, El-Soo made final
announcement to Porportuk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall tell you two things,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;First I shall not be your wife.&nbsp; Will you remember
that?&nbsp; Second, you shall be paid the last cent of the
sixteen thousand dollars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven dollars
and seventy-five cents,&rdquo; Porportuk corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father said sixteen thousand,&rdquo; was her
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not how, but I shall find out how.&nbsp; Now go,
and bother me no more.&nbsp; If you do&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated
to find fitting penalty&mdash;&ldquo;if you do, I shall have you
rolled in the snow again as soon as the first snow
flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was still in the early spring, and a little later El-Soo
surprised the country.&nbsp; Word went up and down the Yukon from
Chilcoot to the Delta, and was carried from camp to camp to the
farthermost camps, that in June, when the first salmon ran,
El-Soo, daughter of Klakee-Nah, would sell herself at public
auction to satisfy the claims of Porportuk.&nbsp; Vain were the
attempts to dissuade her.&nbsp; The missionary at St. George
wrestled with her, but she replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the debts to God are settled in the next
world.&nbsp; The debts of men are of this world, and in this
world are they settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akoon wrestled with her, but she replied, &ldquo;I do love
thee, Akoon; but honour is greater than love, and who am I that I
should blacken my father?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sister Alberta journeyed
all the way up from Holy Cross on the first steamer, and to no
better end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father wanders in the thick and endless
forests,&rdquo; said El-Soo.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there will he
wander, with the lost souls crying, till the debt be paid.&nbsp;
Then, and not until then, may he go on to the house of the Great
Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe this?&rdquo; Sister Alberta asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; El-Soo made answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was my father&rsquo;s belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sister Alberta shrugged her shoulders incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows but that the things we believe come
true?&rdquo; El-Soo went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; The next
world to you may be heaven and harps . . . because you have
believed heaven and harps; to my father the next world may be a
large house where he will sit always at table feasting with
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Sister Alberta asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is your next world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>El-Soo hesitated but for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like
a little of both,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to
see your face as well as the face of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day of the auction came.&nbsp; Tana-naw Station was
populous.&nbsp; As was their custom, the tribes had gathered to
await the salmon-run, and in the meantime spent the time in
dancing and frolicking, trading and gossiping.&nbsp; Then there
was the ordinary sprinkling of white adventurers, traders, and
prospectors, and, in addition, a large number of white men who
had come because of curiosity or interest in the affair.</p>
<p>It had been a backward spring, and the salmon were late in
running.&nbsp; This delay but keyed up the interest.&nbsp; Then,
on the day of the auction, the situation was made tense by
Akoon.&nbsp; He arose and made public and solemn announcement
that whosoever bought El-Soo would forthwith and immediately
die.&nbsp; He flourished the Winchester in his hand to indicate
the manner of the taking-off.&nbsp; El-Soo was angered thereat;
but he refused to speak with her, and went to the trading post to
lay in extra ammunition.</p>
<p>The first salmon was caught at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, and at midnight the auction began.&nbsp; It took place
on top of the high bank alongside the Yukon.&nbsp; The sun was
due north just below the horizon, and the sky was lurid
red.&nbsp; A great crowd gathered about the table and the two
chairs that stood near the edge of the bank.&nbsp; To the fore
were many white men and several chiefs.&nbsp; And most
prominently to the fore, rifle in hand, stood Akoon.&nbsp; Tommy,
at El-Soo&rsquo;s request, served as auctioneer, but she made the
opening speech and described the goods about to be sold.&nbsp;
She was in native costume, in the dress of a chief&rsquo;s
daughter, splendid and barbaric, and she stood on a chair, that
she might be seen to advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will buy a wife?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look at me.&nbsp; I am twenty years old and a maid.&nbsp;
I will be a good wife to the man who buys me.&nbsp; If he is a
white man, I shall dress in the fashion of white women; if he is
an Indian, I shall dress as&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated a
moment&mdash;&ldquo;a squaw.&nbsp; I can make my own clothes, and
sew, and wash, and mend.&nbsp; I was taught for eight years to do
these things at Holy Cross Mission.&nbsp; I can read and write
English, and I know how to play the organ.&nbsp; Also I can do
arithmetic and some algebra&mdash;a little.&nbsp; I shall be sold
to the highest bidder, and to him I will make out a bill of sale
of myself.&nbsp; I forgot to say that I can sing very well, and
that I have never been sick in my life.&nbsp; I weigh one hundred
and thirty-two pounds; my father is dead and I have no
relatives.&nbsp; Who wants me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked over the crowd with flaming audacity and stepped
down.&nbsp; At Tommy&rsquo;s request she stood upon the chair
again, while he mounted the second chair and started the
bidding.</p>
<p>Surrounding El-Soo stood the four old slaves of her
father.&nbsp; They were age-twisted and palsied, faithful to
their meat, a generation out of the past that watched unmoved the
antics of younger life.&nbsp; In the front of the crowd were
several Eldorado and Bonanza kings from the Upper Yukon, and
beside them, on crutches, swollen with scurvy, were two broken
prospectors.&nbsp; From the midst of the crowd, thrust out by its
own vividness, appeared the face of a wild-eyed squaw from the
remote regions of the Upper Tana-naw; a strayed Sitkan from the
coast stood side by side with a Stick from Lake Le Barge, and,
beyond, a half-dozen French-Canadian voyageurs, grouped by
themselves.&nbsp; From afar came the faint cries of myriads of
wild-fowl on the nesting-grounds.&nbsp; Swallows were skimming up
overhead from the placid surface of the Yukon, and robins were
singing.&nbsp; The oblique rays of the hidden sun shot through
the smoke, high-dissipated from forest fires a thousand miles
away, and turned the heavens to sombre red, while the earth shone
red in the reflected glow.&nbsp; This red glow shone in the faces
of all, and made everything seem unearthly and unreal.</p>
<p>The bidding began slowly.&nbsp; The Sitkan, who was a stranger
in the land and who had arrived only half an hour before, offered
one hundred dollars in a confident voice, and was surprised when
Akoon turned threateningly upon him with the rifle.&nbsp; The
bidding dragged.&nbsp; An Indian from the Tozikakat, a pilot, bid
one hundred and fifty, and after some time a gambler, who had
been ordered out of the Upper Country, raised the bid to two
hundred.&nbsp; El-Soo was saddened; her pride was hurt; but the
only effect was that she flamed more audaciously upon the
crowd.</p>
<p>There was a disturbance among the onlookers as Porportuk
forced his way to the front.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five hundred
dollars!&rdquo; he bid in a loud voice, then looked about him
proudly to note the effect.</p>
<p>He was minded to use his great wealth as a bludgeon with which
to stun all competition at the start.&nbsp; But one of the
voyageurs, looking on El-Soo with sparkling eyes, raised the bid
a hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven hundred!&rdquo; Porportuk returned promptly.</p>
<p>And with equal promptness came the &ldquo;Eight hundred&rdquo;
of the voyageur.</p>
<p>Then Porportuk swung his club again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve hundred!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>With a look of poignant disappointment, the voyageur
succumbed.&nbsp; There was no further bidding.&nbsp; Tommy worked
hard, but could not elicit a bid.</p>
<p>El-Soo spoke to Porportuk.&nbsp; &ldquo;It were good,
Porportuk, for you to weigh well your bid.&nbsp; Have you
forgotten the thing I told you&mdash;that I would never marry
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a public auction,&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall buy you with a bill of sale.&nbsp; I have offered
twelve hundred dollars.&nbsp; You come cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too damned cheap!&rdquo; Tommy cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
if I am auctioneer?&nbsp; That does not prevent me from
bidding.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make it thirteen hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen hundred,&rdquo; from Porportuk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you in to be my&mdash;my sister,&rdquo;
Tommy whispered to El-Soo, then called aloud, &ldquo;Fifteen
hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At two thousand one of the Eldorado kings took a hand, and
Tommy dropped out.</p>
<p>A third time Porportuk swung the club of his wealth, making a
clean raise of five hundred dollars.&nbsp; But the Eldorado
king&rsquo;s pride was touched.&nbsp; No man could club
him.&nbsp; And he swung back another five hundred.</p>
<p>El-Soo stood at three thousand.&nbsp; Porportuk made it
thirty-five hundred, and gasped when the Eldorado king raised it
a thousand dollars.&nbsp; Porportuk again raised it five hundred,
and again gasped when the king raised a thousand more.</p>
<p>Porportuk became angry.&nbsp; His pride was touched; his
strength was challenged, and with him strength took the form of
wealth.&nbsp; He would not be ashamed for weakness before the
world.&nbsp; El-Soo became incidental.&nbsp; The savings and
scrimpings from the cold nights of all his years were ripe to be
squandered.&nbsp; El-Soo stood at six thousand.&nbsp; He made it
seven thousand.&nbsp; And then, in thousand-dollar bids, as fast
as they could be uttered, her price went up.&nbsp; At fourteen
thousand the two men stopped for breath.</p>
<p>Then the unexpected happened.&nbsp; A still heavier club was
swung.&nbsp; In the pause that ensued, the gambler, who had
scented a speculation and formed a syndicate with several of his
fellows, bid sixteen thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen thousand,&rdquo; Porportuk said weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen thousand,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p>Porportuk gathered his strength.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twenty
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The syndicate dropped out.&nbsp; The Eldorado king raised a
thousand, and Porportuk raised back; and as they bid, Akoon
turned from one to the other, half menacingly, half curiously, as
though to see what manner of man it was that he would have to
kill.&nbsp; When the king prepared to make his next bid, Akoon
having pressed closer, the king first loosed the revolver at his
hip, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-three thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four thousand,&rdquo; said Porportuk.&nbsp; He
grinned viciously, for the certitude of his bidding had at last
shaken the king.&nbsp; The latter moved over close to
El-Soo.&nbsp; He studied her carefully for a long while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And five hundred,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five thousand,&rdquo; came Porportuk&rsquo;s
raise.</p>
<p>The king looked for a long space, and shook his head.&nbsp; He
looked again, and said reluctantly, &ldquo;And five
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-six thousand,&rdquo; Porportuk snapped.</p>
<p>The king shook his head and refused to meet Tommy&rsquo;s
pleading eye.&nbsp; In the meantime Akoon had edged close to
Porportuk.&nbsp; El-Soo&rsquo;s quick eye noted this, and, while
Tommy wrestled with the Eldorado king for another bid, she bent,
and spoke in a low voice in the ear of a slave.&nbsp; And while
Tommy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Going&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;&rdquo;
dominated the air, the slave went up to Akoon and spoke in a low
voice in his ear.&nbsp; Akoon made no sign that he had heard,
though El-Soo watched him anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Tommy&rsquo;s voice rang out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To Porportuk, for twenty-six thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porportuk glanced uneasily at Akoon.&nbsp; All eyes were
centred upon Akoon, but he did nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the scales be brought,&rdquo; said El-Soo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall make payment at my house,&rdquo; said
Porportuk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the scales be brought,&rdquo; El-Soo
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Payment shall be made here where all can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the gold scales were brought from the trading post, while
Porportuk went away and came back with a man at his heels, on
whose shoulders was a weight of gold-dust in moose-hide
sacks.&nbsp; Also, at Porportuk&rsquo;s back, walked another man
with a rifle, who had eyes only for Akoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the notes and mortgages,&rdquo; said
Porportuk, &ldquo;for fifteen thousand nine hundred and
sixty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>El-Soo received them into her hands and said to Tommy,
&ldquo;Let them be reckoned as sixteen thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There remains ten thousand dollars to be paid in
gold,&rdquo; Tommy said.</p>
<p>Porportuk nodded, and untied the mouths of the sacks.&nbsp;
El-Soo, standing at the edge of the bank, tore the papers to
shreds and sent them fluttering out over the Yukon.&nbsp; The
weighing began, but halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, at seventeen dollars,&rdquo; Porportuk had
said to Tommy, as he adjusted the scales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At sixteen dollars,&rdquo; El-Soo said sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the custom of all the land to reckon gold at
seventeen dollars for each ounce,&rdquo; Porportuk replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And this is a business transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>El-Soo laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a new custom,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It began this spring.&nbsp; Last year, and the
years before, it was sixteen dollars an ounce.&nbsp; When my
father&rsquo;s debt was made, it was sixteen dollars.&nbsp; When
he spent at the store the money he got from you, for one ounce he
was given sixteen dollars&rsquo; worth of flour, not
seventeen.&nbsp; Wherefore, shall you pay for me at sixteen, and
not at seventeen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Porportuk grunted and allowed the
weighing to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weigh it in three piles, Tommy,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A thousand dollars here, three thousand here, and here six
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was slow work, and, while the weighing went on, Akoon was
closely watched by all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He but waits till the money is paid,&rdquo; one said;
and the word went around and was accepted, and they waited for
what Akoon should do when the money was paid.&nbsp; And
Porportuk&rsquo;s man with the rifle waited and watched
Akoon.</p>
<p>The weighing was finished, and the gold-dust lay on the table
in three dark-yellow heaps.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a debt of my
father to the Company for three thousand dollars,&rdquo; said
El-Soo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take it, Tommy, for the Company.&nbsp; And
here are four old men, Tommy.&nbsp; You know them.&nbsp; And here
is one thousand dollars.&nbsp; Take it, and see that the old men
are never hungry and never without tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy scooped the gold into separate sacks.&nbsp; Six thousand
dollars remained on the table.&nbsp; El-Soo thrust the scoop into
the heap, and with a sudden turn whirled the contents out and
down to the Yukon in a golden shower.&nbsp; Porportuk seized her
wrist as she thrust the scoop a second time into the heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is mine,&rdquo; she said calmly.&nbsp; Porportuk
released his grip, but he gritted his teeth and scowled darkly as
she continued to scoop the gold into the river till none was
left.</p>
<p>The crowd had eyes for naught but Akoon, and the rifle of
Porportuk&rsquo;s man lay across the hollow of his arm, the
muzzle directed at Akoon a yard away, the man&rsquo;s thumb on
the hammer.&nbsp; But Akoon did nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make out the bill of sale,&rdquo; Porportuk said
grimly.</p>
<p>And Tommy made out the till of sale, wherein all right and
title in the woman El-Soo was vested in the man Porportuk.&nbsp;
El-Soo signed the document, and Porportuk folded it and put it
away in his pouch.&nbsp; Suddenly his eyes flashed, and in sudden
speech he addressed El-Soo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not your father&rsquo;s debt,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;What I paid was the price for you.&nbsp; Your sale
is business of to-day and not of last year and the years
before.&nbsp; The ounces paid for you will buy at the post to-day
seventeen dollars of flour, and not sixteen.&nbsp; I have lost a
dollar on each ounce.&nbsp; I have lost six hundred and
twenty-five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>El-Soo thought for a moment, and saw the error she had
made.&nbsp; She smiled, and then she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;I made a
mistake.&nbsp; But it is too late.&nbsp; You have paid, and the
gold is gone.&nbsp; You did not think quick.&nbsp; It is your
loss.&nbsp; Your wit is slow these days, Porportuk.&nbsp; You are
getting old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer.&nbsp; He glanced uneasily at Akoon, and was
reassured.&nbsp; His lips tightened, and a hint of cruelty came
into his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will
go to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the two things I told you in the
spring?&rdquo; El-Soo asked, making no movement to accompany
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head would be full with the things women say, did I
heed them,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that you would be paid,&rdquo; El-Soo went
on carefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I told you that I would never be
your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was before the bill of sale.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Porportuk crackled the paper between his fingers inside the
pouch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have bought you before all the world.&nbsp;
You belong to me.&nbsp; You will not deny that you belong to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong to you,&rdquo; El-Soo said steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You own me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porportuk&rsquo;s voice rose slightly and triumphantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As a dog, I own you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a dog you own me,&rdquo; El-Soo continued
calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, Porportuk, you forget the thing I told
you.&nbsp; Had any other man bought me, I should have been that
man&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; I should have been a good wife to that
man.&nbsp; Such was my will.&nbsp; But my will with you was that
I should never be your wife.&nbsp; Wherefore, I am your
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porportuk knew that he played with fire, and he resolved to
play firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I speak to you, not as El-Soo, but
as a dog,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I tell you to come with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He half reached to grip her arm, but with a
gesture she held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Porportuk.&nbsp; You buy a dog.&nbsp; The
dog runs away.&nbsp; It is your loss.&nbsp; I am your dog.&nbsp;
What if I run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the owner of the dog, I shall beat
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you catch me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then catch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached swiftly for her, but she eluded him.&nbsp; She
laughed as she circled around the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catch
her!&rdquo; Porportuk commanded the Indian with the rifle, who
stood near to her.&nbsp; But as the Indian stretched forth his
arm to her, the Eldorado king felled him with a fist blow under
the ear.&nbsp; The rifle clattered to the ground.&nbsp; Then was
Akoon&rsquo;s chance.&nbsp; His eyes glittered, but he did
nothing.</p>
<p>Porportuk was an old man, but his cold nights retained for him
his activity.&nbsp; He did not circle the table.&nbsp; He came
across suddenly, over the top of the table.&nbsp; El-Soo was
taken off her guard.&nbsp; She sprang back with a sharp cry of
alarm, and Porportuk would have caught her had it not been for
Tommy.&nbsp; Tommy&rsquo;s leg went out, Porportuk tripped and
pitched forward on the ground.&nbsp; El-Soo got her start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then catch me,&rdquo; she laughed over her shoulder, as
she fled away.</p>
<p>She ran lightly and easily, but Porportuk ran swiftly and
savagely.&nbsp; He outran her.&nbsp; In his youth he had been
swiftest of all the young men.&nbsp; But El-Soo dodged in a
willowy, elusive way.&nbsp; Being in native dress, her feet were
not cluttered with skirts, and her pliant body curved a flight
that defied the gripping fingers of Porportuk.</p>
<p>With laughter and tumult, the great crowd scattered out to see
the chase.&nbsp; It led through the Indian encampment; and ever
dodging, circling, and reversing, El-Soo and Porportuk appeared
and disappeared among the tents.&nbsp; El-Soo seemed to balance
herself against the air with her arms, now one side, now on the
other, and sometimes her body, too, leaned out upon the air far
from the perpendicular as she achieved her sharpest curves.&nbsp;
And Porportuk, always a leap behind, or a leap this side or that,
like a lean hound strained after her.</p>
<p>They crossed the open ground beyond the encampment and
disappeared in the forest.&nbsp; Tana-naw Station waited their
reappearance, and long and vainly it waited.</p>
<p>In the meantime Akoon ate and slept, and lingered much at the
steamboat landing, deaf to the rising resentment of Tana-naw
Station in that he did nothing.&nbsp; Twenty-four hours later
Porportuk returned.&nbsp; He was tired and savage.&nbsp; He spoke
to no one but Akoon, and with him tried to pick a quarrel.&nbsp;
But Akoon shrugged his shoulders and walked away.&nbsp; Porportuk
did not waste time.&nbsp; He outfitted half a dozen of the young
men, selecting the best trackers and travellers, and at their
head plunged into the forest.</p>
<p>Next day the steamer <i>Seattle</i>, bound up river, pulled in
to the shore and wooded up.&nbsp; When the lines were cast off
and she churned out from the bank, Akoon was on board in the
pilot-house.&nbsp; Not many hours afterward, when it was his turn
at the wheel, he saw a small birch-bark canoe put off from the
shore.&nbsp; There was only one person in it.&nbsp; He studied it
carefully, put the wheel over, and slowed down.</p>
<p>The captain entered the pilot-house.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;The water&rsquo;s
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akoon grunted.&nbsp; He saw a larger canoe leaving the bank,
and in it were a number of persons.&nbsp; As the <i>Seattle</i>
lost headway, he put the wheel over some more.</p>
<p>The captain fumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a
squaw,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>Akoon did not grunt.&nbsp; He was all eyes for the squaw and
the pursuing canoe.&nbsp; In the latter six paddles were
flashing, while the squaw paddled slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be aground,&rdquo; the captain protested,
seizing the wheel.</p>
<p>But Akoon countered his strength on the wheel and looked him
in the eyes.&nbsp; The captain slowly released the spokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer beggar,&rdquo; he sniffed to himself.</p>
<p>Akoon held the <i>Seattle</i> on the edge of the shoal water
and waited till he saw the squaw&rsquo;s fingers clutch the
forward rail.&nbsp; Then he signalled for full speed ahead and
ground the wheel over.&nbsp; The large canoe was very near, but
the gap between it and the steamer was widening.</p>
<p>The squaw laughed and leaned over the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then catch me, Porportuk!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Akoon left the steamer at Fort Yukon.&nbsp; He outfitted a
small poling-boat and went up the Porcupine River.&nbsp; And with
him went El-Soo.&nbsp; It was a weary journey, and the way led
across the backbone of the world; but Akoon had travelled it
before.&nbsp; When they came to the head-waters of the Porcupine,
they left the boat and went on foot across the Rocky
Mountains.</p>
<p>Akoon greatly liked to walk behind El-Soo and watch the
movements of her.&nbsp; There was a music in it that he
loved.&nbsp; And especially he loved the well-rounded calves in
their sheaths of soft-tanned leather, the slim ankles, and the
small moccasined feet that were tireless through the longest
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are light as air,&rdquo; he said, looking up at
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no labour for you to walk.&nbsp; You
almost float, so lightly do your feet rise and fall.&nbsp; You
are like a deer, El-Soo; you are like a deer, and your eyes are
like deer&rsquo;s eyes, sometimes when you look at me, or when
you hear a quick sound and wonder if it be danger that
stirs.&nbsp; Your eyes are like a deer&rsquo;s eyes now as you
look at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And El-Soo, luminous and melting, bent and kissed Akoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we reach the Mackenzie, we will not delay,&rdquo;
Akoon said later.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will go south before the winter
catches us.&nbsp; We will go to the sunlands where there is no
snow.&nbsp; But we will return.&nbsp; I have seen much of the
world, and there is no land like Alaska, no sun like our sun, and
the snow is good after the long summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will learn to read,&rdquo; said El-Soo.</p>
<p>And Akoon said, &ldquo;I will surely learn to
read.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was delay when they reached the
Mackenzie.&nbsp; They fell in with a band of Mackenzie Indians,
and, hunting, Akoon was shot by accident.&nbsp; The rifle was in
the hands of a youth.&nbsp; The bullet broke Akoon&rsquo;s right
arm and, ranging farther, broke two of his ribs.&nbsp; Akoon knew
rough surgery, while El-Soo had learned some refinements at Holy
Cross.&nbsp; The bones were finally set, and Akoon lay by the
fire for them to knit.&nbsp; Also, he lay by the fire so that the
smoke would keep the mosquitoes away.</p>
<p>Then it was that Porportuk, with his six young men,
arrived.&nbsp; Akoon groaned in his helplessness and made appeal
to the Mackenzies.&nbsp; But Porportuk made demand, and the
Mackenzies were perplexed.&nbsp; Porportuk was for seizing upon
El-Soo, but this they would not permit.&nbsp; Judgment must be
given, and, as it was an affair of man and woman, the council of
the old men was called&mdash;this that warm judgment might not be
given by the young men, who were warm of heart.</p>
<p>The old men sat in a circle about the smudge-fire.&nbsp; Their
faces were lean and wrinkled, and they gasped and panted for
air.&nbsp; The smoke was not good for them.&nbsp; Occasionally
they struck with withered hands at the mosquitoes that braved the
smoke.&nbsp; After such exertion they coughed hollowly and
painfully.&nbsp; Some spat blood, and one of them sat a bit apart
with head bowed forward, and bled slowly and continuously at the
mouth; the coughing sickness had gripped them.&nbsp; They were as
dead men; their time was short.&nbsp; It was a judgment of the
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I paid for her a heavy price,&rdquo; Porportuk
concluded his complaint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a price you have never
seen.&nbsp; Sell all that is yours&mdash;sell your spears and
arrows and rifles, sell your skins and furs, sell your tents and
boats and dogs, sell everything, and you will not have maybe a
thousand dollars.&nbsp; Yet did I pay for the woman, El-Soo,
twenty-six times the price of all your spears and arrows and
rifles, your skins and furs, your tents and boats and dogs.&nbsp;
It was a heavy price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old men nodded gravely, though their weazened eye-slits
widened with wonder that any woman should be worth such a
price.&nbsp; The one that bled at the mouth wiped his lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it true talk?&rdquo; he asked each of Porportuk&rsquo;s
six young men.&nbsp; And each answered that it was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true talk?&rdquo; he asked El-Soo, and she
answered, &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Porportuk has not told that he is an old
man,&rdquo; Akoon said, &ldquo;and that he has daughters older
than El-Soo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, Porportuk is an old man,&rdquo; said
El-Soo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for Porportuk to measure the strength his
age,&rdquo; said he who bled at the mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;We be old
men.&nbsp; Behold!&nbsp; Age is never so old as youth would
measure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the circle of old men champed their gums, and nodded
approvingly, and coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him that I would never be his wife,&rdquo; said
El-Soo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you took from him twenty-six times all that we
possess?&rdquo; asked a one-eyed old man.</p>
<p>El-Soo was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true?&rdquo;&nbsp; And his one eye burned and
bored into her like a fiery gimlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will run away again,&rdquo; she broke out
passionately, a moment later.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always will I run
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is for Porportuk to consider,&rdquo; said another
of the old men.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is for us to consider the
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price did you pay for her?&rdquo; was demanded of
Akoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No price did I pay for her,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was above price.&nbsp; I did not measure her in
gold-dust, nor in dogs, and tents, and furs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old men debated among themselves and mumbled in
undertones.&nbsp; &ldquo;These old men are ice,&rdquo; Akoon said
in English.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not listen to their judgment,
Porportuk.&nbsp; If you take El-Soo, I will surely kill
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old men ceased and regarded him suspiciously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We do not know the speech you make,&rdquo; one said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He but said that he would kill me,&rdquo; Porportuk
volunteered.&nbsp; &ldquo;So it were well to take from him his
rifle, and to have some of your young men sit by him, that he may
not do me hurt.&nbsp; He is a young man, and what are broken
bones to youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akoon, lying helpless, had rifle and knife taken from him, and
to either side of his shoulders sat young men of the
Mackenzies.&nbsp; The one-eyed old man arose and stood
upright.&nbsp; &ldquo;We marvel at the price paid for one mere
woman,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;but the wisdom of the price is no
concern of ours.&nbsp; We are here to give judgment, and judgment
we give.&nbsp; We have no doubt.&nbsp; It is known to all that
Porportuk paid a heavy price for the woman El-Soo.&nbsp;
Wherefore does the woman El-Soo belong to Porportuk and none
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sat down heavily, and coughed.&nbsp; The
old men nodded and coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will kill you,&rdquo; Akoon cried in English.</p>
<p>Porportuk smiled and stood up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have given
true judgment,&rdquo; he said to the council, &ldquo;and my young
men will give to you much tobacco.&nbsp; Now let the woman be
brought to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Akoon gritted his teeth.&nbsp; The young men took El-Soo by
the arms.&nbsp; She did not resist, and was led, her face a
sullen flame, to Porportuk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit there at my feet till I have made my talk,&rdquo;
he commanded.&nbsp; He paused a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am an old man.&nbsp; Yet can I
understand the ways of youth.&nbsp; The fire has not all gone out
of me.&nbsp; Yet am I no longer young, nor am I minded to run
these old legs of mine through all the years that remain to
me.&nbsp; El-Soo can run fast and well.&nbsp; She is a
deer.&nbsp; This I know, for I have seen and run after her.&nbsp;
It is not good that a wife should run so fast.&nbsp; I paid for
her a heavy price, yet does she run away from me.&nbsp; Akoon
paid no price at all, yet does she run to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came among you people of the Mackenzie, I was of
one mind.&nbsp; As I listened in the council and thought of the
swift legs of El-Soo, I was of many minds.&nbsp; Now am I of one
mind again but it is a different mind from the one I brought to
the council.&nbsp; Let me tell you my mind.&nbsp; When a dog runs
once away from a master, it will run away again.&nbsp; No matter
how many times it is brought back, each time it will run away
again.&nbsp; When we have such dogs, we sell them.&nbsp; El-Soo
is like a dog that runs away.&nbsp; I will sell her.&nbsp; Is
there any man of the council that will buy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old men coughed and remained silent</p>
<p>&ldquo;Akoon would buy,&rdquo; Porportuk went on, &ldquo;but
he has no money.&nbsp; Wherefore I will give El-Soo to him, as he
said, without price.&nbsp; Even now will I give her to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching down, he took El-Soo by the hand and led her across
the space to where Akoon lay on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a bad habit, Akoon,&rdquo; he said, seating her
at Akoon&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;As she has run away from me
in the past, in the days to come she may run away from you.&nbsp;
But there is no need to fear that she will ever run away,
Akoon.&nbsp; I shall see to that.&nbsp; Never will she run away
from you&mdash;this is the word of Porportuk.&nbsp; She has great
wit.&nbsp; I know, for often has it bitten into me.&nbsp; Yet am
I minded myself to give my wit play for once.&nbsp; And by my wit
will I secure her to you, Akoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stooping, Porportuk crossed El-Soo&rsquo;s feet, so that the
instep of one lay over that of the other; and then, before his
purpose could be divined, he discharged his rifle through the two
ankles.&nbsp; As Akoon struggled to rise against the weight of
the young men, there was heard the crunch of the broken bone
rebroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just,&rdquo; said the old men, one to
another.</p>
<p>El-Soo made no sound.&nbsp; She sat and looked at her
shattered ankles, on which she would never walk again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My legs are strong, El-Soo,&rdquo; Akoon said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But never will they bear me away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>El-Soo looked at him, and for the first time in all the time
he had known her, Akoon saw tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyes are like deer&rsquo;s eyes, El-Soo,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it just?&rdquo; Porportuk asked, and grinned from
the edge of the smoke as he prepared to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just,&rdquo; the old men said.&nbsp; And they sat
on in the silence.</p>
